"We recently got DirecTV after seeing their ad blitz for 75 HD channels.  They brag about their ""digital picture and sound,"" and their great customer service. The truth is the only way to get digital picture and sound is with a HDTV and an HDMI.  Their picture is actually worse than the picture we got with Comcast.  Not to mention there is no two year agreement with cable, no picture loss when it rains, you do not have to pay for ""leased equipment, and you do not need an ugly dish hanging on your house. When we purchased our most recent HDTV, we figured we would replace the DVR we had with DirecTV and get an HD DVR to replace it. DirecTV told us we would have to pay $299 for the privlige of leasing their receiver from them.  In addition to this we would have to pay $50 because we were a new customer ""and had not established a credit history with them.""  Also, we would have to pay $20 for shipping and handling and extend our contract for another two years. Maybe DirecTV thinks it is in the cellphone business because all they want to do is lock you into long-term contracts and make you bleed money for them forever.  Their symbol should be a ball and chain because that is what they really are.  Cable here I come!",1,DIRECTV H20-600 High Definition DIRECTV Satellite Television Receiver

"If you're reading this.  You are thinking about dropping some serious cash so I will try and help you out! If you're trying to decide between this, which is Adobe production studio premium or the Standard Edition do not buy  The Standard Edition, you get so much more with this version, I repeat do not buy the Standard Edition. You're probably interested in getting the Adobe production studio premium edition.  I have to tell you, this is a great product, the dynamic link is such an amazing feature a links together.  Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe encore, seamlessly.  You can take Adobe After Effects compositions into premiere Pro without rendering.  Then if you need to edit the composition you just pop back into after effects, tweak it adjust it pop back into premiere and is automatically updated.  It is just an amazing thing to see it in action. After effects has got a total facelift, along with encore audition and premiere Pro.  Gone is the ""palette-tosis"" of the old programs.  Where you would lose palettes have palettes on top of palettes not know where to find a palette.  The new facelift is totally awesome. Stability: I've been using these programs for few days, and they are totally stable.  One crash, I think I had and I think was my fault.  Adobe encore, I feel is the best improvements from the old version making a DVD with the new flowchart is so amazingly simple. Adobe After Effects 7.0 after effects is the bomb is you such an amazing program.  Once you get past the user interface and learn some of the nuances you can do almost anything and mean anything with video is awesome.  7.0 has the ton of user presets.  The text effects are great.  The backgrounds that you can create that come as presets, all editable.  A cool thing is with a new user presets, you can see them actually preview and Adobe Bridge.  This is cool! Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 this program now is more in line with user interface from premiere elements.  The one thing I really enjoy now about from your Pro 2.0.  Is that I can import MPEG files from my replay TV and edit them.  This is something that was sorely lacking in from your Pro 1.5 user interfaces been revamped in the new style.  He just feels a lot cleaner smoother and more stable. Adobe audition 2.0 this program, I think has gotten the most drastic user interface upgrade.  I'm not really in the audio is what don't really know what under the hood is changed.  I do know it's got ASIO drivers now.  That is a big deal if you're an audio.  But now the user interface is more in line with all the other a video products.  Was nice about audition now is that if you have a audiophile in premiere Pro 2.0.  You can now send it to audition, change it or modify it save it and it brings it back right into premiere.  No reimporting, that is so cool. Adobe encore 2.0 if you're wondering about Adobe encore this upgrade is nice.  The automatic slideshow creator, while only limited to 99 photos per slideshow is a nice feature.  I'd use it already.  There are some limitations in the slideshow creator like again, only 99 photos per slideshow but you could link unlimited slideshows back to back to back, but you're still limited to 99.  In each slideshow.  Stability I feel in this program is vastly improved the old encore.  I was so like I was teetering on the edge of losing my whole project.  I feel of it safer and encore 2.0.  It has a ton more templates is integration with Adobe Photoshop and with Adobe After effects is amazing.  You will love it! Adobe Bridge 1.0 this program is quirky.  It crashed about 20 times.  It has the potential to be really great, but it's good takes a more time to get there.  Building of this program as your media manager.  Again, it's not there yet.  I'm still using Adobe Photoshop elements, the tagging portion to organize my digital photographs. Adobe dynamic link this program really isn't a program, but it is a program.  If you know and mean?  Basically dynamic link links together all of the applications in the production studio.  Now the hitch is you can't get this if you buy the program separately.  So to see it in action, you have to buy the production studio.  Another reason why you should invest.  But once you have it up and running.  You will be amazed.  It simplifies workflow drastically one place all this in action I bought it enough said. So there you have it my micromini review of Adobe production studio premium.  Something to keep in mind, this does come with a disk of totaltraining that reviews each of the programs give you some of the new features it about two hours.  Not really great but it's free.  When you install it the first time.  You wanna register online seeing a free plug-in are a couple templates that they offer you if you miss this opportunity the first time you install it.  You will not get another chance I believe, so make sure you register. This install comes on five DVDs income of five gigs of loops for Adobe audition, a bunch of DVD templates, and other goodies. Another thing to note, you will not be old to upgrade individual programs.  Once you buy the production studio.  So this means that if a new version of Photoshop CS3 comes out.  You will have to wait to upgrade the production studio.  You can't upgrade individual products.  This kind of rots but I guess you gotta deal. This does have online activation That's all I can think of at the moment, if I think of anything more.  I'll update this review.  Go to Adobe's web site and download the program demos.  The one thing you won't get is dynamic link so you'll have to use your imagination and see how it will fit in.  Also check out the creative cow (dot) com. With the production studio, you also get Adobe Photoshop CS2 in Adobe Illustrator CS2.  That is a huge bonus. Have some fun and get it done",1,"Adobe Production Studio Premium (Upgrade from Premiere Pro, Photoshop, or After Effects Pro)"

"After reading many reviews of the fm transmittion criteria, I found myself in the market for one. The best reviews that I could find where the Monster IcarPlay (newer) and the Kensington 33185, I could not find either specific model anywhere near me, so I went down to the local bestbuy and got myself the Griffin RoadTrip. I was quite skeptical to see how this would perform because I read many negative reviews regarding Griffin products. After purchasing it for $118 CAD (about $105 US), I went in the car and tried it out. the set up is quite basic and after a few minutes I was listening to my nano with decent sound quality (same as local radio stations). I live in the biggest suburbia in North America, Mississauga, Ontario and the transmittion is quite good. Pros: It does not skip, even as the ipod wiggles from the road bumps It stays in tact Easy to use Good sound quality Comes with everything you need, every ipod model capability Can be used with your PC or Mac to transmit sound for you home stereo Convinient comes with Doc+holder+clip (s) Cons Constant access to the ipod battery could mean that the battery's life is ending faster than it should. the sound quality isn't top notch. (after all it is a transmitter, very minor complaint) Ipod users limit your sounds to minimum when the ipod is playing because it will not have an effect on the transmittion at all. This is probabbly a good thing. Over all I'd like to give it a 5, but 4 seemes more appropriate, due to price and capability. As far as fm transmittion goes this product will not dissapoint you.",1,Griffin Technology 4031-RDGC RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger and Cradle for iPod (Charcoal)
"After skimming through the other reviews I have to aggree with most of them.  The notebook was fast and more than adequate for school.  It played DVDs well and accepts aftermarket software to its nice memory space without slowing down performance. On the downside... It DID get very hot from use and the battery life was very very short.  Even after reconditioning the battery a few times it only gained a marginal increase in battery life.  It doesn't handle gaming very well.  The frame rate was ridiculously slow if a lot is going on in the game and the loading times were exceptionally long.  But, nobody ever said this was a gaming computer and it isn't the reason I bought the thing. For my conversion from desktop to notebook, I was happy with the decision.  I only wish I hadn't bought it so soon after it entered the market as I paid top dollar not knowing that the depreciation over one single year was 50% of the original cost. Don't get me started on the customer service.  Absolutely worthless and time-consuming to tackle.  All I can say is don't hold your breath for them to ""give you a call sometime"" to resolve any issues or get some information to you.  Whatever you do while on the phone with CS, don't trashtalk any species of the bovine pursuasion. Very Happy with the computer but not with the service!!!",0,"HP Special Edition L2005US 14"" Notebook PC (AMD Turion 64 Mobile Technolgy ML-30, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD?R/RW/CD-RW Combo Drive)"
"After six weeks of use, I enjoy falling asleep to the iPod. Very convenient for that. I appreciate being able to fall asleep to the iPod and being able to wake to a preset radio station or alarm. Many devices will awaken you to whatever sound source put you to sleep. However...the alarm time is tricky to change. Lots of ""keystrokes"" and knob-twisting. Also--and this is a big problem in our house--you cannot seem to set the radio volume for the alarm. It increases in volume to become VERY loud, and will force you to turn it down if you want to listen for a while. You can set the sleep volume, and the radio volume (for normal listening), but cannot control the alarm volume. If it is next to your head, it will be very intrusive when you awaken, and is sure to bother your partner who awakens at a different time (but from a different clock, since this has but one alarm setting). If the ihome is not next to your head, you cannot turn it down because you can't reach it (oops--did you not buy the remote control at extra cost?). Middling audio quality, poor radio reception, dangling AM and FM antenna wires (including a clunky AM loop antenna at the end of a wire--great for a 1930s-vintage crystal set, for those of you who know what those are). I am looking for a scrap of window tinting material to tone down the way-too-bright display. It disturbs even at the lowest brightness setting. The main problems with this are in the software, and all could be fixed with a few revisions. This is a very versatile player at a pretty low price. Don't expect a Bose.",0,iHome iH5 Clock Radio for iPod White
"After setting up the Receiver all over my house, the unit just could not hook up with the satellite, so no XM radio.  The one in my car works fine. I was told by the XM folks that perhaps I should  try to get a replacement antenna from Delphi.  (By the way the ""background noise flutter"", described in earlier reviews, I could hear, so that continues to be a problem"".)  So I have bought the Boombox which doesn't work, I have a XM unit that I can't play and I have a subscription that is useless.  I am very disappointed with Delphi.  I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews.",0,Delphi SA10034 XM Portable CD Audio Boombox for the XM SKYFi Radio Receiver
"After searching the web for days for a cd/dvd rack that would help me solve a media storage crisis in my family room, I finally ordered this Atlantic storage rack.  Assembly was fairly straitforward, although definitely not intuitive.  Luckily, my 15 year old daughter was eager to help decipher the instructions. Upon completion of assembly and loading of the rack, I was very pleased with the result.  The volume of items that can be stored is excellent.  In my case, use of the provided dividers allowed access to switches and outlets behind the rack.  It is important to balance the volume of items with the use of the dividers, otherwise, items on the rack will be too loose to be stable.  In part, this is because the rack is made up of rods, not a flat shelf. Over all, a very good value for the dollar.",0,Atlantic CD Storage Rack (ELF464C47)
"After some careful research, I bought this product and was pretty satisfied.  The buttons are complicated and it isn't straightforward, but after reading the manual - I pretty much grasped it.  It comes with a 90 day warranty which is great until you read the fine print.  It will cost you more in shipping than it is to buy a new one.  Mine worked for 120 days and then the speaker component died.  Still keeps time.  No sound.  Imagine my dismay when I overslept after buying a new alarm clock.  This is a poor choice and poorly made.  Spend a few extra bucks for something else.

"After so many months of use, I could say this router is right on the money. I had to restart it maybe once a month or less, though the root cause might have been the DSL modem. It's been working well in a mixed environment--different OSes, card adapters, etc.. For those of you who have PPPoE networks, this router works indeed very well (INSTALL INCLUDED). Get as fast as you can to the web interface and drive things from there--security, firmware updates, monitoring, etc. And now, a word of caution: do not trust 100% the built-in firewall. There have indeed been 5 or 6 attacks, over 9 months of use, detected by the software firewall I kept. So, to address this issue, keep all firewalls running and up to date. As for the price, people around speak of all kinds of coupons/rebates. Unless you have the option to wait, get it right away and see the difference!",0,Belkin F5D52314 4-Port Cable/DSL Router
"Prior to buying this product, we were using 2 different wireless phone systems so we its a pain to transfer calls, maintain phone numbers, caller IDs, etc. We needed to replace it with one phone system that can accommodate at least 4 handsets so 2 years ago we bought the Uniden DCT646-4 expandable wireless set.  Here are my thoughts on this phone: * Setup was not quick as each handset needs to be configured but it was relatively smooth and straightforward.  Once you know how to configure one handset, the rest are mechanical. * I have had handsets with better call quality but also had some that are worse, so this phone is probably average when it comes to call quality.  Its clear enough for me and the person on the other line so it works. * Each handset can be identified by name so I thought that was a nice feature.  If I needed somebody, I know which handset to call/page to get to the right person or room. * The voicemail button setup can be a bit cumbersome when you change providers and voice mail access numbers (like we did) as each handset needs to be configured.  I don't know how many people have different voice mails for the same line but this should have been one global (propagating to all handsets) setup or at least an option to have it configured as such. * The caller ID is useful to screen out callers but unfortunately there is no way to just ignore the call and stop the ringing for all handsets all at once.  You can press ""End"" on one handset but only that one stops ringing.  The rest will keep on ringing until the voicemail system takes over.  This was especially irritating when our youngest was still a baby and we forgot to take the handset out of the room he's sleeping in or when there are visitors in the house.  There should be one button to just ignore the call and send it to the voicemail. All in all, there are things I would want improved on this system but for the price and features this Uniden system is a great value.",0,"Uniden DCT646-4 Digital 2.4 GHz expandable Cordless system, call waiting/ caller ID and accessory handset and charger"
"We have a 97 Jeep Cherokee and the black vinyl wheel surround (not sure of the term) had faded terribly, they were almost a whitish grey. We applied about 3 coats of this product (it goes on easily with the applicator bottle it comes with). The first coat was splotchy because the vinyl soaked up the stuff. Then, by the 2nd and 3rd coat, it was becoming more of an even coat. Whalaa, I cannot believe the difference. I will try to post before and after pictures. It has made a huge difference in how the vehicle looks, and now we will see how it holds up over time. We had enough to do three coats around all four wheels. There seems to be enough in the bottle to repeat another treatment if necessary in the future. I would recommend this product.",0,Forever Black Bumper & Trim Cleaner & Reconditioner Kit
"I have listened to the hype about TIVO for a couple of years now.  With the hundred dollar plus rebates on the hardware, as well as substantial discounts on the service, I thought I'd break down and give it a try.  Here' my experience... The Good... 1. Very intuitive user interface for the set-up screens and remote; it could be argued that Tivo is the gold standard for ease of use 2. Very secure packaging of unit 3. Included cabling is of unusally high quality (not Monster cable grade, but still very good for included cabling) 4. Installation directions are very easy to follow (though not as good as Dell's color coded design) 5. There is a 30 day money back guarantee 6. Customer reps are friendly and well trained (and they speak english too!) The Bad... 1. The front of the box says all required cables are included; the directions state that a second A/V cable -- required for the recommended installation method -- is ""user provided"" (i.e., sold separately) 2. The service is not compatible with some VoIP services 3. Though set-up is easy, it is a one to two hour ordeal, requiring multiple visits to websites and countless button presses to ensure interoperablity with the cable box 4. The remote is pretty low tech looking; it also has a lower quality feel tha leads me to belive that I'll be shopping for a replacement in a year or less The Ugly... 1. They try to get you to sign up for a three year, pre-paid service contract; if after 30 days you find that you don't like/need Tivo, you forteit all that money -- ouch! 2. When I attempted to use the website to activate the service, the site was unstable and wouldn't allow me to complete the order.  I then called the 800 number for service, where the hold time exceed 25 minutes.  Hope I never have cause to call again as this is a totally unacceptable wait time Net/net: this is a well thought out product that does just what it says it does -- enables consumers to watch TV on their terms.",0,TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80 Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video Recorder
"I've been using the Sansa e260 for about a month and it has worked flawlessly. It integrates easily Windows XP and I load most files to it using Windows Explorer. The Sansa firmware utility updated the unit just fine, just plug the unit into the USB port and it happens automatically. Charging of the battery is very slow using the USB port it works much better either with a car or AC charger. Sound quality is very good and as long as you volume level your MP3's before loading them into the Sansa the db levels are constant. Navigation is a snap with the wheel and the other controls, very easy to learn. Overall I am completely satisfied with this product.",0,Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot
"I had been using an iRiver h10 for a little under a year and it died a horrible firmware death that was unrepairable, so I got this unit as its replacement. Let's clear up one thing up front:  THIS UNIT DOES NOT SUPPORT MP3's ABOVE 256KBPS.  SanDisk does not acknowledge this or post this as a part of the product, but their tech support will admit it if you call them about it.  The 256kbps cap isn't  asuggestion -- the unit will choke and stutter badly on anything higher bitrate.  So just know that ahead of time that you'll have to convert your MP3's down to 256kbps at least before you can use them on it, and plan accoridngly.  For me it was an annoying oversight (especially since my old iRiver H10 happily played 320kbps files), but not a really big deal because with a half-hour of work I could convert my 320kbps files down to 256kbps and transfer them over for use. All that aside, it's a great little player with a very nice display for its size and value.  The sound is good, controls and UI are solid, and the battery life is fanatstic (2 more hours batt. life than a Nano).  Its 4GB of storage is a solid capacity and value. The playlist plays through a number randomize function, which is a GOOD thing.  Each song is assigned a number, and when a randome number is chosen the corresponding song plays.  This is nice for one reason -- if you change the contents of the drive while it's paused, the device won't choke when it tries to resume a file that's no longer there.  Instead it will play whatever file has that same number now, or skip ahead to a new number if that number simply no longer exists.  It's a very small thing in the grand scheme of things, but a big annoyance that it prevents and I've seen other players not be abel to handle such a simple scenario. One other downside I found was the media conversion tool to import photos and video (since this unit plays video).  On the video side it unfortunately converts to QuickTime, which is IMHO an absolutely terrible video format that results in bloated movie size on the device (80 MB video files become ~160 MB after conversion).  However it converted over my little DivX movies with almost no hitch.  And the screen is small for video, but not entirely unwatchable.  I personally still find it more novelty than useful though, but it deifnitely works as well as it can. On top of it all, it also offers MicroSD expansion, and a rather nice FM Tuner -- neither of which an iPod can boast. So if you don't want to be an iSheep, and you don't need iTunes or similar music management software to help manage your device and are happy with Windows Explorer copy-n-paste to move your media on, this really is a very nice little player for its price.  I have to say I enjoy it a lot and would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone specifically trying to avoid Apple's iPod empire.
