"After seeing my brother's VR3 in action, I gritted my teeth, ignored the bad reviews and took the risk.  Mine has performed just as well as his does.  Pros:  the compact design is totally unobtrusive in my dash, the forward/back controls are easy to use while driving, having the option of connecting by USB or audio-in is very handy.  Cons:  I had a little difficulty finding a good station among the presets (but that could just be a peculiarity of my town), when the unit is turned off it resets to the beginning of the track instead of just pausing, shuffle works fine when it's reading from a smaller storage device but gets super slow when it's reading too many files.  I use mine mostly with a USB microSD card reader.   My microSD card is 4G, and if I fill it up, start-up and shuffle become unbearably slow.  With 1-2G on it, it works fine (who really needs 4G of music at one time anyway?).  I've been super happy with mine so far, and haven't had any of the technical difficulties that others say they've had.  Most of the cons I've mentioned are common for transmitters of this price-range, and the pros are the reasons I chose this one over the others in the price-range.  I highly recommend getting a small USB microSD card reader to use with this, the ""Sandisk MobileMate Micro"" is absolutely tiny - about half the length of the average Flashdrive so it won't stick out of the unit like a sore thumb J.  I've also gotten in the habit of skipping to the next song right before I turn the car off, so I don't hear the same song start over when I turn it on next.  That's just a small annoyance from an otherwise fantastic little device.",9/5/2008,0.0,0.0,A1QMQ2AXURPVRN,B000EO771W,4.0,0.0,528342.0,10.0,"Good product in general, GREAT for the price!",0.0,0,2293,Roadmaster USA,32.32,"MP3/Wma Fm Transmitter w/USB & Audio Input, White",EAN->0023034086048,Brand->Roadmaster USA,Feature->Plays MP3 & WMA files from USB storage devices,Color->White,Feature->Connects to 12V DC auto power,Manufacturer->Roadmaster USA,Model->VRFM8W,MPN->VRFM8W,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->Roadmaster USA,Studio->Roadmaster USA,"Title->MP3/Wma Fm Transmitter w/USB & Audio Input, White",UPC->023034086048,,,,Feature->14 preset FM frequencies,Feature->Works with backwardly compatible USB 2.0 drives,Feature->Digital LED display,ItemDimensions,Label->Roadmaster USA
"After searching around the internet for a pen-mouse with pressure-sensitivity, I came upon this product and decided to give it a try despite the fact that I could find little information on it.  I returned it after two days of use. The ""ergonomic"" pen is unbelievably light and isn't weighted to improve ease of use.  The pen is made out of hollow plastic, it rests strangely in the hand, and it doesn't seem to respond consistently. In order to get any use out of the pen, I was forced to hold it at an awkward angle (almost a 90-degree angle) and, over a short period, I found that it would stop responding as I eased back into a more natural position.  What's more is that the cord, which weighs far more than the pen itself, constantly got in the way and made it even more difficult to use. What really excited me about this pen-mouse was that it had a fairly high number of levels of pressure-sensitivity (as high as my low-cost Wacom pad!).  Unfortunately, this didn't matter as precision was an absolute joke and it was nearly impossible to force the pen-mouse to do any of the things I needed (from drawing to web browsing and other simple actions). I highly recommend staying away from this mouse.  Whether you're using it for its ergonomic ""benefits"" (after holding this pen at a 90-degree angle for an hour or so my wrist was killing me) or for its potential for artistic application, this pen-mouse is a flat-out disaster.",4/3/2006,10.0,10.0,A2NBASPZH4H3T,B000ELQO8W,1.0,0.0,528657.0,8.0,Difficult and poor product,0.0,0,53343,Ezonics Corporation,49.99,Epen Mouse Solution,Brand->Ezonics,BatteriesIncluded->0,EAN->0655490528000,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->MODEL- EZ-528 VENDOR- EZONICS FEATURES- ePen Mouse Solution The comfortable mousing solution.

"After sent away to properly learn how to marry, Victor, while practicing jokingly puts a finger on a branch. But, when a corpse of a murdered bride pops out and claims that she is Victor's rightful bride, He has a dilimma that sends him to find out if there really is true love in death til we part. Tim Burton has been notoriously known to have a weird style of film aking. Look at his films, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, Big Fish. They have all have strange characters. This film is no exception. Burton sets out that he still has his style and weirdness. He is probably the only one of the filmmakers that can show beauty in things grotesque. He takes the weirdest things, the weirdest people, and somehow makes them human. He shows that the grossest things have a heart, and that you can care for them. He is a great storyteller. He can take stories and make them into fairy tales, myths of legend, or just plain legend. He strokes the imaginations of all his viewers by providing us with great visuals and vibrant colors. Tim Burton can make some very beautiful films. This can be added to that list. Danny Elfman has created some great songs and scores for Burton. This was probably one of his most solid efforts as a composer. His score perfectly fit the scenes and his songs were great. He can take the music and make the scene even more beautiful with his score. His score can make or break the film, but it didn't have to because of some of the score was fantastic. The voice work was solid. I thought that Johnny Depp was perfect for the part of Victor, because he has that style and the voice that would suit the character. Also, Helena Boham Carter also did some great voice work, and I am glad to see that she is getting mainstream work, after all of her long years on the independent circuit. Also, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee were great as their respective characters. The only problem that I had was with the short runtime. I felt that they could've made it longer and devolop it more, but it is stop-motion animation, after all. Even if they made it longer, it would take more time and money to do that and it would end up making the film come out later than this year. I was glad that they got a beautiful film done in the short amount of time that they did it in. I was please that they accomplished a whole lot. Overall, This was a beautifully, vivid movie made by the king of quirkyness, Tim Burton. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was a great animaton, and it deserves some regonition and respect from people that love and cherish Burton's films. I feel that Tim Burton is a great master of the art of making quirky things beautiful. Some people say that Sam Mendes is the king, but in my humble opinon, I feel that Tim Burton is the king of all things quirky. I urge you to see this marvolously beautiful film.",9/25/2005,3.0,1.0,A36HBE2C5SQ2E6,B000C3L27U,4.0,0.0,535095.0,69.0,This movie is alive and well.,0.0,0,1119,Warner Home Video,19.98,Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition),Actor->Emily Watson,Actor->Johnny Depp,Actor->Tracey Ullman,Actor->Helena Bonham Carter,Actor->Paul Whitehouse,Actor->Jane Horrocks,Actor->Enn Reitel,Actor->Deep Roy,Actor->Danny Elfman,Actor->Stephen Ballantyne,AudienceRating->PG (Parental Guidance Suggested),Binding->DVD,Brand->none,Director->Mike Johnson,Director->Tim Burton,EAN->9781419802461,Actor->Joanna Lumley,Actor->Albert Finney,Actor->Richard E.

"After seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas about five-hundred times (that may not be an exaggeration), and loving it every time I saw it, I couldn't wait to get something new from the same creator as Nightmare. Corpse Bride was that something new, and though Nightmare is definitely the better of the two, Corpse Bride is still fun and entertaining nonetheless. It revolves around the arranged marriage of two young people, names of Victor and Victoria, both of whom have no idea what they are getting into until the very last moments before the marriage. But surprisingly, at the rehearsal, they have a connection, and their marriage seems as though it won't be such a bad thing. Still, though, Victor is nervous to the point of bumbling, and fails his marriage vows miserably. Told to practice his lines, the rehearsal is postponed and Victor makes a quick escape into the woods. While here, he practices on the nearby trees, only not everything is a tree. In accident, he places his ring on the hand of a dead woman named Emily, who becomes Victor's corpse bride. From here, Victor must find a way to escape from the land of the dead and get back to his fiancee Victoria, while we, the viewers, are trying to figure out how the corpse bride got to where she is now. Though short, Corpse Bride still has a lot to offer. The animation is great, far more detailed than Nightmare, and the moody settings are what you expect from Tim Burton. And the character designs are excellent; every one is unique from the rest and all of them have personality. To add to that, the voice acting was exceptional as well, with songs that sound similar to that of The Nightmare Before Christmas. And where the length of the film may not be so much, the DVD extras surely make up for it. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, or who grew up watching the claymation Christmas cartoons. Also, as an artistic film, there are few to rival Corpse Bride. It sets a dreary mood at the beginning, and continually adds to that mood throughout, yet is still able to draw laughs.",2/4/2006,5.0,4.0,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000C3L27U,4.0,1.0,535290.0,264.0,Entertaining Nonetheless,0.0,0,1119,Warner Home Video,19.98,Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition),Actor->Emily Watson,Actor->Johnny Depp,Actor->Tracey Ullman,Actor->Helena Bonham Carter,Actor->Paul Whitehouse,Actor->Jane Horrocks,Actor->Enn Reitel,Actor->Deep Roy,Actor->Danny Elfman,Actor->Stephen Ballantyne,AudienceRating->PG (Parental Guidance Suggested),Binding->DVD,Brand->none,Director->Mike Johnson,Director->Tim Burton,EAN->9781419802461,Actor->Joanna Lumley,Actor->Albert Finney,Actor->Richard E.

"After some extensive research, I settled on the D50 as the best value in the dSLR market.  I worked it down to the D50, the D70s, and the Canon Digital Rebel. It was my goal to jump from taking a bunch of point-and-shoot photos with my much-beloved Fuji camera to really learning photography with some level of sophistication by jumping to a DSLR with some real power. I am still working my way along the learning curve as a photographer, but I have been thrilled with the d50.  I had the benefit of a friend with a d70 and was able to handle that camera extensively before my purchase.  It has some added features, but if you, like me, are not at a photography level where you need cutting-edge stuff like depth-of-field preview, you would never know the difference.  I have yet to take a photograph and have the feeling that I wish I had spent the extra money on the d70.  It may well be that this is an ""entry-level"" dSLR, but if that is a fair description, it is also fair to say that the ""entry"" point is very high.  More often than not, the phrases ""value"" or ""entry-level"" imply ""get ready to be disappointed.""  That is definitely NOT the case here.  If you've never had a pro-level dSLR, at least, you'll feel like you're using a Ferrari. One concession I did make to the d70 was the lens, however.  The consensus on the lens is that the d70 comes with a better base lens than the d50, so I bought the d50 body and the d70 kit lens separately.

"After several months of exhaustive research, and seemingly endless trips to BB and CC to compare models directly, I finally ended up purchasing this set. Amazingly, I have no regrets whatsoever.  That's right, zero buyer's remorse!  For the money (see the Target pricing in other reviews), you simply cannot do better than this set.  SD satellite is surprisingly good--even compared to my previous CRT.  After calibration DVDs are stunning.  HDTV finally gives me that 'looking out a window' feeling. Minor quibbles:  The remote is indeed very cheap.  I use an all-in-one learning remote anyway, so that's not an issue.  Some people don't like the glass in front of the screen; it does have an anti-glare coating, but it will give you some reflections depending on your viewing area (as will CRTs, and plasma).  Some people have reported problems with the image turning green occasionally when using the HDMI input.  Tech support will send you a new input box (easily swapped out with a couple of screws) that corrects the problem.  A few people have reported their sharpness setting not ""sticking"" on the component inputs.  I haven't had either of these issues. If you have a surround sound system, you can remove the factory speakers (below the screen in the image above), and lower it on its stand, so that it looks much more sleek, and plasma-like.

"After skimming through the other reviews I have to aggree with most of them.  The notebook was fast and more than adequate for school.  It played DVDs well and accepts aftermarket software to its nice memory space without slowing down performance. On the downside... It DID get very hot from use and the battery life was very very short.  Even after reconditioning the battery a few times it only gained a marginal increase in battery life.  It doesn't handle gaming very well.  The frame rate was ridiculously slow if a lot is going on in the game and the loading times were exceptionally long.  But, nobody ever said this was a gaming computer and it isn't the reason I bought the thing. For my conversion from desktop to notebook, I was happy with the decision.  I only wish I hadn't bought it so soon after it entered the market as I paid top dollar not knowing that the depreciation over one single year was 50% of the original cost. Don't get me started on the customer service.  Absolutely worthless and time-consuming to tackle.  All I can say is don't hold your breath for them to ""give you a call sometime"" to resolve any issues or get some information to you.

"After seeing the advertisement for this product I thought it sounded like the perfect solution for our little newborn who drinks way too fast from the playtex nursers. Turns out after spending almost thirty dollars to get these home, she can't use them. They were too hard for her to nurse from. After a very frustrating 10 minutes, she was only able to get one ounce of milk and sucked in a lot of air from all the fussing that happened during those ten minutes. That didn't help her spitting up problem. I read other reviews from other websites and found that many mothers of newborns said these bottles were just too hard for new babies.

"After selling two computers, yes two, to my parents i decided to get something that was gonna last for many years, and something that i could do anything on that i could do on a desktop. Also something that was portable was what i wanted most. After searching and searching and countless computers, i realized i was gonna have to pay the BIG bucks to achieve what i wanted. I had saw the Qosmio but had always hated how ""finger printed"" up the interior looked when i saw them in stores, from people using them. Its a pet peave that i don't like prints or smudges for that matter. So after a lot of thought i went for the F25 from a website called Clearance Club for 1349 plus tax, i didnt think it was a bad deal till i saw the F25 on the Toshiba Direct site for 1099$, so i thought i just got ripped. After careful consideration i looked at the G25 which was only a few hundred dollars more, 1349!! to be exact, they didnt have any in stock until a few days later so i said what the hell and went for it, even though i wasnt to fond of the gargantuen 17"" screen. Well having gotten the G25 when i still had the F25 i decided why not test them side by side, being that it was a weekend and couldnt ship the other back yet. Here's the Pro's and Con's i found. F25-Sharp Clean Picture G25-A Bit Brighter, although maybe to bright? F25-Great Harman Kardon speakers, very loud and bassy G25-Same speakers although not as loud,(i must point out both of these were refurbished for one reason or another, so the speakers or sound card may have been the issue here) F25-Basic 100gig hard drive, seems like a lot until you record live TV. G25-Serial ATA 120 gig, double hard drives, 20 gigs makes a difference. F25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-64mb-Doom 3 1024x768 low quality. G25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-128mb-Doom 3 1024x800 High Quality-Its noticeble side by side. No hesitation. Also 1440x900 Max screen resolution. F25-WiFi b/g Wireless G25-Same F25-15.4 inch wide screen,Very Light, Good for toating around. G25-17.4 inch wide screen, Very Heavy, Not good for toating around. Although better for movies at home. F25-Darker Black Interior-Smudges aren't AS noticeble, but still bad. G25-The thing i hate most,terrible at fingerprints and smudges, has a slightly glossier black face. F25-Good DVD-R-RW multi burner, basic pop-out from the side. G25-Very cool DVD-R-RW multi Burner, inserts from the front, slide in compartment. Burns a little quicker than the F25 i think. Loads loud though, minor issue. F25-1.86 pentium 750M processor, centrino. G25-2.01 Pentium 760M Processor, Centrino. F25-1024 gig of RAM G25-1 gig F25-Refurbished-Cheapist anywhere, Toshiba Direct-1099$, New on other sites, anywhere from 1600, to 2000$. G25-Refurbished-Cheapest anywhere, Toshiba Direct-1349, New on other sites anywhere from, 1549$ to 3000$. So with all these side by side the differences are very minor between the F25 and the G25, there were certain things i liked better abuot each but when it came to mas-multi tasking and just over all ability i had to go for the G25 even though its not perfect its the best your gonna get for a laptop, multimedia center. All others definately fall short when it comes to the specs this thing has. Basic laptops even HP's higher series most come with an ATI Radeon 200M which u can't even put on medium resolution 800x600 for Doom 3 or Farcry. Even some of the higher end Hp's come with a Nvidia Geforce 7300 go, which is a low end 7 series, not even as good as the 6600.

"After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection.

"After seeing some examples of photos from this gem of camera paired with a substantial [...] and getting a good price on selling my D100, did I finally make the plunge to a professional level digital camera. I am a serious amateur and I have owned this camera for about three months and shot off nearly 2000 photos under a variety of conditions. The camera is used with an ED glass zoom Nikkor lens G 28-200 mm and a Nikon SB600 flash. And I could not be happier with my new toy, um . . . tool. The image quality is superb with its 12 MP CMOS sensor. The build of the camera is a very durable magnesium body with well placed and well made controls. You can change ISO, image size, autofocus settings, shift from autofocus to manual and a number of other setting right from the camera body. Potentially if I became familiar enough with these controls I could make the changes without ever taking my eye from the camera. Furthermore, the camera is environmentally sealed and meant to be used under a variety of demanding conditions though I do not recommend taking it or any other electronic device into the rain without adequate protection. The grip both horizontal and vertical felt secure in my hands. There is a vertical shutter button with dials on the body to alter shutter and aperture settings. There are locks to prevent inadvertant firing of the vertical shutter button and shifting of the auto sensor for focus and metering. Below the depth of field preview button there is an additional button to which you can aside a variety of functions. I have it set to spot metering. The camera body unlike other Nikons does not come with a pop up flash though it does have a hotshoe. There is an additional sensor for white balance over the pentaprism. For those taking sports the camera has a high speed crop mode which shoots off much faster pictures but at a reduced resolution of 8 MP. There are three selections of metering: spot, center and the new 3D Color Matrix Metering II all of which may be changed from the right side of the pentaprism. I've found the Matrix Metering to be strikingly accurate with just a few times where the metering is fooled but this has been primarily where there have been extremes in lighting such as a night scene with a bright street light in the view. The auto white balance though not perfect has certainly been an improvement over that of the D100. You can also select your own white balance either from a grey card, a white card or even from ambient light. I have primarily use the autowhite balance. When I've had to use autofocus mainly for my cute rocket powered niece, it has been quite fast and accurate. The camera uses an electric cable release. You need to remove a small screw top from the front portion of the camera on side opposite of the shutter. At the time of this review the Nikon brand release MC-30 are not in stock anywhere though I've seen the fancier MC-36 available several places. A third party release such as one from Adorama is less expensive and seems to do the job. The camera performs very well at most of its ISO settings. The lowest is 100 and the highest which is the equivalent of 3200 called ""HI-2."" The noise up to HI-1 (1600) is actually not bad since it is more like film grain than true digital noise which is neither entirely random nor nearly as pleasing. For those adverse to noise, the camera has an excellent noise reduction system which eliminates nearly all noise up to about 400 to 800 ISO. I have not noted any banding my JPEG images. There are actually a ton of other features which I am not going to detail here. There are a few downsides to this camera. It is quite heavy and large. I'd recommend that you go to your local camera store and hold the camera. Those with neck and back problems may find it too heavy and those with small to medium small sized hands may find it difficult to operate. Also due to its size you are going to attract attention so you'll need to be more vigilent. Because of the high resolution of the camera you need to have excellent technique mainly in holding the camera. The Matrix Metering is so usually right on that you will notice more of your photos will be far better exposed. Though ""correct"" exposure is a matter of artistic intent. You also need excellent glass on the camera. If know you will be using the cable release I would remove the small screw top from the camera body and leave it at home. It is screaming to get lost.

"After some 400 photos, I have mixed feelings about the camera.  I've been using non-DSLRs for four years, and have owned 5 of these.  All of the others allow more consistent results than the XT.  However, I am relearning my old SLR ways (the hard way). I LOVE the viewfinder and the speed!  The housing looks good, but scratches easily.  As with all DSLRs, it is exceptionally easy to get dust on the CMOS sensor (and difficult to clean).  Sure wish they'd fix this (couldn't they put a charge on the sensor to repel rather than attract dust?)!  AWB mode yields varying results (looking at a series of daylight photos taken in different directions seconds apart, it's amazing that some are overexposed, some underexposed, and some have obviously better white balance than others).

"After seeing this display in person, I had to run out and buy one. In Windows at 2650x1600 it seems to display things about the same size as my 20"" monitor does at 1600x1200, but you get more than twice as much on the screen as the 20"" (2.1333 times to be more exact). Besides hearing about how stunningly beautiful it is, here are some things you might like to know about it: It will hook directly to a MacBook Pro's DVI port without any adapters or mods, and display at full resolution. If you're using it on a PC, you need dual-link DVI capability (not the same as dual DVI). I thought this would mean paying a lot of money for a new video card, but it doesn't. I called ATI and ordered a Radeon x1650 Pro PCIe card direct, which cost $150. It displays at the full 2650x1600 resolution with no problems, has 512MB DDR2 memory, video out, and though it includes several cables and adapters, none are required to hook the display up. In fact it seems faster than my two year old $700 card did. I do mostly digital photography (Photoshop), and it is plenty fast. I don't think that unless you're doing 3D modeling or serious gaming, that you'll need anything more. It is also Vista ready, so it can handle all the features of Vista (translucent windows or whatever. I don't have Vista). There are 3 plugs on the cable. One is the DVI plug, the second is a Firewire (400 not 800), and the third is USB. The latter two are to provide you with 2 USB and 2 Firewire ports at the back of the display. Now for the drawbacks, or should I say drawback. The only positioning adjustment is the ability to tilt the display. Although it is easy to rotate the image 90 degrees, it would require rigging something up to rotate the monitor. There is no height adjustment so I can't squeeze the center speaker of my audio underneath the display (I'd call it a monitor, but since it's Apple, they refer to them as displays). Included software assist you in setting the levels and color to the right settings. When I bought it, I considered it an extravagance, but after using it for a few weeks, I've changed my mind. It increases productivity immeasurably being able to keep multiple windows open, not having to zoom in and out while editing photographs, and being able to display 39 columns (64 pixel) and 66 rows (20 pixel) of an Excel spreadsheet.Or 3 legal size pages at 100% side by side in Word without scrolling. Pretty cool, huh? It's also extremely stylish, and along with my DiNovo Edge keyboard, it could go in a museum. When I bought it from Amazon, it was $1,924 plus a 5% discount at the time, no tax, and $10 shipping. It came out to be about $125 less than what I would have paid from Apple with their education program discount (since they charge 6% tax and I'm also getting 3% in rewards bonuses using my Amazon credit card). But even at full retail it would have been worth it. I am in love with this display! Any of you gamers interested in an ATI Radeon x850XT Platinum graphics card? Oh yeah, the new card takes up only one slot instead of two, so there's another bonus... Originally I was going to use this display with my MacBook Pro for my digital photo work, but now that it's connected to the PC, I literally can't take my eyes off of it. Does anybody know of a cable or switch that would allow me to use it for both and switch between them conveniently?

"After some of the reviews I expected more, but as the phrase goes. It's OK for the price. I got this because I often camp in a remote area and my young kids get a little nervous when things go bump in the night. I thought we'd be able to look out into the woods and see all the critters at play and ease their minds, but so far I haven't seen a thing.

"After seeing the reviews in every magazine saying the new Microsoft Money 2005 beat the new Quicken hands down, I thought maybe I should upgrade from 2003 to 2005 premium. I was particularly enticed by claims that it allowed you to sync automatically with almost any bank. I have Fleet and Citibank accounts, neither of which would auto-sync with 2003, so I was relegated to downloaded statements each month and importing them. I was also expecting to be able to sync with my online brokerage accounts at Charles Schwab and Ameritrade. But not only did the Fleet and Citibank accounts fail to sync, Ameritrade, whichhad worked before failed to sync, and the other Schwab did so about half the time. I called in to tech support and they weren't able to fix the problem, but said they'd been getting a lot of such calls. The product only came out in the last week, so I will cut them some slack and wait for updates which they said would be coming in a few weeks, but I must say I was disappointed after hearing such glowing reviews from magazines. The problem with building software from the ground up, as Microsoft has done with this new version of money, is that things that worked perfectly well in previous versions often don't work. I would have thought the magazines would mention these syncing difficulties, considering how common they appear to be... but then again, Microsoft does have a lot of money (no pun intended), and if you're a magazine you probably wouldn't want to get on their bad side.

"After seeing the ads for the Digital Frame, My mother ordered it for my birthday.  It arrived today *August 1)in time, but right now - we are disappointed.

"After seeing the bad reviews, I almost didn't purchase PDF Producer. However, I called Data Becker (during normal business hours at 617-614-0600) and, with very little trouble, got a live person on the phone who answered all of my questions and allayed my concerns.  Two good hints: It only works with Win 2000 or XP (as it says right on the specs); and, it's important to close ALL programs (including printer software) running in the backgroun before loading. PDF Producer loaded flawlessly in a few minutes on my Windows XP system with MS Office 2003. It works just like any other printer driver, and I personally like the idea that it doesn't intimately integrate with other programs (such as putting an icon on the task bars) -- if something does go wrong with PDF Producer my other programs are still in business. The product works excellently -- making PDF files of anything that can normally be printed. The PDF Producer settings needed a bit of tweaking to get the quality and file size I wanted, and this was easily done following the built-in help screens or the manual that came with the retail package.

I read all the information on the Wilife website, and also what was available here on Amazon before purchasing.  Because our needs were specific, I made sure that they would be filled with this kit.  Here's what we needed: 1.  Remote camera that did not require hardwiring to connect to computer (computer is upstairs, camera position is downstairs). 2.  Camera triggered by motion, rather than always recording. 3.  Online access to the recorded video. After reading about the system, I realized I'd need to not only pay for the camera kit, but to get online access to recorded video (streaming video access is free) I'd also need to sign up for WiLife Platinum, at an additional $80 a year.  A steep price, but worth it if we'd be able to see any activity in the house by reviewing the recorded video online every evening. The system was very easy to set up, and worked acceptably well (the software did have a glitch when changing settings which I never did work out).  After signing up for platinum I was able to access recorded video online with my laptop computer, but my mobile device (HP iPaq 5915) would only access live video. I tried different operating systems (upgrading my Explorer Mobile, and switching to Opera Mobile), but still was only able to get live video to work. After re-reading the information on the WiLife site which stated: ""Go beyond live Internet viewing. Access your recorded video at anytime, anywhere.  Use easy search tools to locate and view video by date, time, and site - with up to the minute availability."" The site even showed a photo of a person accessing recorded video with a Blackberry, I assumed this must be an issue with my hardware, my software, or just 'operator error', so I continued to work through the problem. After a week of trying every possible solution, I contacted WiLife support, and after a few useless emails which did not address the problem, finally received one stating: ""Cellphones/handheld devices can not do remote playback. They can only do remote viewing in relay mode."" So, it is being packed up and shipped back to Amazon. I'm left wondering why Logitec would use a proprietary viewer for the recorded video, when the streaming video uses the regular Windows viewer available on all systems? And the biggest why - why would they advertise that remote playback was available 'anywhere anytime' when in fact it is NOT? In my opinion, this system is not worth anything to the average user until we can access recorded video via mobile device.  Once Logitec actually offering what they're advertising (anywhere, anytime), I'll happily purchase the product again.",6/30/2008,3.0,2.0,A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS,B000E0I9K4,1.0,1.0,666099.0,23.0,"Hardware is great, software severely lacking.",0.0,0,0,WiLife,299.99,WiLife L³kwerks Digital Video Surveillance Starter Kit - DVS-800i,"Color->Gray, Black",BatteriesIncluded->0,EAN->0853650001008,Brand->WiLife,Feature->Monitor and record up to six locations in real-time,Label->WiLife,ListPrice,Manufacturer->WiLife,Model->DVS-800i,MPN->DVS-800i,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->WiLife,"SpecialFeatures->Processing Power: 400 MHzvDSP, Onboard Image Encoding: Windows« Media Video 9, Onboard Image Processing: Motion detection up to 16 zones; Auto brightness, Resolution Selectable: 320 X 240 or 640 X 480 pixels, Frame Rate & Bit Rate: Selectable, Color Depth: 10 bits",Studio->WiLife,SystemMemorySize->16,"Feature->View full-color video on PC, over Internet or on web-enabled cell phone or handheld device",Feature->Camera's power adapter also transmits images to PC over existing powerlines; no networking required,Feature->Werks software program included.,"Feature->Warranty: 90 days, limited",ItemDimensions

"After seeing my friend's Modix HD-3510 hard drive based multimedia player, I wanted one too.  But, I wanted to do one better than my friend and get the Mvix MV-5000U (I think this model is the latest and supposedly most advanced of its kind) with the FM transmitter thinking I can use it in the car without the cassette adapter.  WRONG. Maybe I don't know how to use this unit properly because the sound quality is bad.  I hear hissing noise through the FM.  Same song plays well if I connect it directly to my sound system. The remote control is not very responsive.  I have to press the same button several times before it does anything. On the positive note, it plays most of my DivX, XviD files and all of my MP3 files.  Watching the video on the TV is a great experience.  Installing and configuring the hard drive was a snap.  I haven't tried the DVD ISO but hope it will play just as well. On the negative note, yes it is portable but its bigger than the Modix (about 50% thicker).  I feel the screen on the unit is useless.  After a week, the fan on the unit started to make noticeable sound. Because I had a chance to compare my Mvix with my friends Modix, I feel that I made a bad choice.  Mvix looked very slick on the internet but not in real life.  The company's support was sub par in my experience (their web support is non existent).  I am not a technically savvy person.

"After searching through reviews online, I decided to purchase the HB-207.  Users had lauded its comfort, ease of use, and versatility.  The bag is very sturdy, comfortably designed, and has the capability of holding a ton of equipment.  In fact, there are times when I have loaded down the bag to the point that it didn't meet airline carry-on weight expectations.  Nevertheless, because it is a backpack, I've never been asked to weigh it or check it at the airline counter. The bag is a bit large for casual use.  I would not recommended it as a day pack due to its bulky girth.  The bag is also not as convenient as a traditional shoulder bag when it comes to accessing your gear.  Despite its size, however, it still comfortably fits in an airline luggage compartment. The rear laptop compartment fits a bit snug.  If you are using a Mac or a small, slim computer, you should be fine. But if your computer measures greater than 15 1/2"" x 11"" x 2"", you'll be shoving and prodding just to get it to fit. In conclusion, the bag's pros consist of sturdy, well-crafted design, comfort, space, versatility, and, to a degree, inconspicuousness.  The cons might be it's lack of easy access on the field and its girth, rendering it useless for day trips.

"After searching for so long time, finally I decided to buy this TV from Amazon.com, which was something I never did before. Naturally it is risky to buy a big stuff that you cannot see in advance and you cannot return. However, for the reason I do not know, I bought it from Amazon.com. I like product from Sony, which looks so great in store. But I do not like Japanese Government because they never admitted that Japan killed/tortured millions of Asian people. So I do not want to buy a product from Japan and let me feeling hurt. Anyway, I bought this Samsung DLP TV, which turns out to be a good decision. Everything seems so good.

"After six weeks of use, I enjoy falling asleep to the iPod. Very convenient for that. I appreciate being able to fall asleep to the iPod and being able to wake to a preset radio station or alarm. Many devices will awaken you to whatever sound source put you to sleep. However...the alarm time is tricky to change. Lots of ""keystrokes"" and knob-twisting. Also--and this is a big problem in our house--you cannot seem to set the radio volume for the alarm. It increases in volume to become VERY loud, and will force you to turn it down if you want to listen for a while. You can set the sleep volume, and the radio volume (for normal listening), but cannot control the alarm volume. If it is next to your head, it will be very intrusive when you awaken, and is sure to bother your partner who awakens at a different time (but from a different clock, since this has but one alarm setting). If the ihome is not next to your head, you cannot turn it down because you can't reach it (oops--did you not buy the remote control at extra cost?). Middling audio quality, poor radio reception, dangling AM and FM antenna wires (including a clunky AM loop antenna at the end of a wire--great for a 1930s-vintage crystal set, for those of you who know what those are). I am looking for a scrap of window tinting material to tone down the way-too-bright display. It disturbs even at the lowest brightness setting.

"After some reasearch on the different camcorders available on the market, I had no doubt that the Canon Optura 60 was the superior choice.  After receiving the unit I had no problem getting set up and was snapping pictures and making videos in no time. One feature that sets this camcorder apart from others is it's ability to take high quality 2 mega-pixel still shots, recording them to a Secure-Digital card.  From my previous experience with Canon cameras it seems that they really know what they are doing in terms of digital photography and the Optura 60 continues to amaze.  The camera has produced still shots that are equal or better in quality to my Olympus C-740UZ. The video quality is excellent and it is very easy to copy your still shots and videos using USB 2.0 OR Firewire to your Windows XP PC. Despite a complicated array of features, the camera can be very simple to use for those who just want to set everything to ""AUTO"", then point and shoot. Goods: * High res 2 mega-pixel stills stored on SD card * Built-in flash and 14x optical zoom * Optical image stabilization to ensure minimized ""shaky hand"" effect * Easy to dump videos and stills to XP PC * Amazingly wide array of features packed into a small sized unit * Excellent still picture quality * Good performance for shooting 'on the fly' * Continuous mode for quick sequential still shots * Can snap 640x480 still shots to SD card while recording video to tape * More... Bads: * Package does not include a DV tape * Included 16MB MMC card is far too small * Included battery is a little short-lived * Firewire DV cable not included Additional items I bought: * Pack of DV tapes * 512MB SD Card * High-capacity BP2L14 battery * CB2LT battery charger, enabling charging of both batteries at once (one in camera, one in charger) You'll also need a carrying case that snugly fits the Optura 60 and the above items.",4/13/2005,95.0,95.0,A39XMF85HDCRHB,B0007W2H48,5.0,0.0,707529.0,4.0,Excellent.,0.0,0,490,Canon,999.0,Canon Optura 60 MiniDV Camcorder w/14x Optical Zoom,Binding->Electronics,BatteriesIncluded->1,Brand->Canon,BatteryDescription->1 Lithium NB-2LH,DisplaySize->2.5,Feature->Print & Share technology for easy downloading and transferring,FloppyDiskDriveDescription->None,HasRedEyeReduction->1,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Canon,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Canon,MaximumFocalLength->64.4,MinimumFocalLength->4.6,EAN->0013803050691,"Feature->14x optical zoom, 280x digital zoom",Feature->Advanced 9-point Auto Intelligent Autofocus,Feature->2.2 Megapixel CCD with RGB Primary Color Filter,"Feature->6 new Scene Modes - Foliage, Fireworks, Beach, Snow, Sunset and Spotlight"

"After some research, I purchased this product and it works really well. I used it on a trip from DC to NY and it got me right to the front door of where I needed to be. It's simple interface is very easy to use, there are no downloads required. I didn't open the manual at all - it's that easy. You can save your locations into a favorites menu.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles like traffic navigation or cell phone connectivity of the higher priced options, but as a basic GPS it's great. If I had one complaint it's that sometimes it chooses some wonky ways to get to various places.  For instance I had to go to an address that turned out to be less than a mile away. Instead of taking me on the main highway and doing a simple turn, it took me through the back roads of the division next to my house.

"After searching for a case of this type for my U2 ipod, I settled on this one because it's the only one of its type I found available.  First, I'm disappointed that there are so few available for us ghetto-ipod owners. =)  The only clear cases I could find were for the nano, shuffle, and video.  This is the only one for my 4th gen U2 special edition so my choices were limited. That being said, this case does its job.  It's crystal clear so you can see the beautiful black and red of my ipod, as well as the signatures on the back.  The sleeve it came with didn't fit on my ipod.  I couldn't get it on so I just put my ipod carefully into the case.  It fits very well and my ipod isn't rattling around in the case.  The bottom locks tightly so I'm not worried about my ipod falling out which is good.  I'm not planning on removing the ipod from the case because I'm afraid of it getting scratched, but I want to try to fit the protective sleeve on when it's not so hot and humid outside.  It has been said that there's a problem with dock connectors which I can see, since the opening only allows enough room for the USB cable or firewire to connect to the ipod. Long story short: For purposes of protecting the ipod, it seems stellar.  I wouldn't recommend sliding the ipod in and out without the protective sleeve, which at the moment doesn't fit on my ipod.

"After seeing a wide range in the prices for HDMI cables, I did some research into why is it.

"After some patience in setting up, we are delighted with finally receiving DTV!!  One serious thing that should be noted: if you have an analog set, as we do, MAKE SURE you set the rear little switch to analog or you'll get a white screen.  This is not in the instructions and we had the unit replaced thinking it was defective. We live about 25 to 40 miles to the transmitters past some hills and are connecting our Sony WEGA analog set to the unit.  Unless you live relatively close and have a flatland situation, you really should get a quality UHF antenna (Radio Shack has an excellent one), a rotor system, and a preamp. that mounts next to the antenna to boost the signal (Channel Master 7777 Titan2 VHF/UHF model).  Although the receiver is strong, a good clean signal is really important to reduce/eliminate dropouts. Goods: quality picture, offers signal strength meter to help point up your antenna, simple and well-laid-out controller, strong RF amplifier for boosting signals, good price. Quirks: Took us a long time (over days) to figure out the best way to add channels: use autolearn once for the bulk and then rotate your antenna to the other channels and add them manually.  The controller's IR beam is aimed a little UP, so if you aim it at your TV, it actually hits the receiver.  The zoom feature is great for channels that use HDTV and then have a smaller display for normal 3x4 programs - but as it zooms to fill your screen, it distorts the width so the pix is out of proportion; bad planning.   Next, you cannot use the controller to directly access the ""-"" channels (e.g. 3-1, 12-3, etc.).  The picture tends to ""pixelate"" when there is fast motion, scene changes, anything that creates a demand for repainting the screen info.  I don't know if this is the compressor power inside the receiver or that's the way it's being transmitted. Summary: We are simply ecstatic with the receiver.  We watched a PBS special ""Celtic Women"" with crystal clear presentation and digital sound.  We live with the fuzzy pix when it has to keep up with motion - it's not that bad.  The antenna is the key: it MUST be exactly aligned with the station transmitter (see Antennaweb.org - they have point-up directions) or things go to pot.

"After seeing BOSE's Noise Cancelling headset, and reading the tech specs, I was a bit Leary of the quality of these , but they are more than worth it. If you are familiar with the concept of White Noise, then you should understand what this headset does; the difference is that this headset detects sound values, and conteracts  with varying degrees of the white noise. Whilst a white noise machine in the background is often set at a constant value, these headsets have microphones on the outer part of the left and right head-sets to detect external noise values , as well as a circuit operating the internal noise reduction.The  noise reduction will  vary according to the external sound value, and works very well, not great, but extremely  good for the price. This noise cancelling  device will go for 30 hours on standard high value triple a batteries ( one for the headset) but will work longer with Lithium E2 Batteries. If this helps: these headphones are Noise cancelling, and so whilst they do a great job of reducing standard noise, if the range is above 85-95 db, you will have a diminishing return. Since these headphones can work with no music input at all, if you use stereo ear-buds that go down the ear canal a way ( I have a set of these, but I can't remember the model and make... I checked, they are KOSS, a model called THE PLUG, and buy a small packet with different  adapters, believe me, you will need it, but do not buy the adaptors from RADIO SHACK, you will regret it, unless  you have no other choice, try COMPUSA if you are in the US, or JB-HIFI if you are in East Coast Australia) and place the Noise Cancelling  headphones over the buds, then you will have a better blocker, however, the earbuds that extend down the ear canal should be used carefully, since too high a volume is harmful, but the better response in bass, and full range sounds, are good. Its best to check the NC6 specs for the actual full coverage. If you need something more heavy duty, then go for BOSE, but these are good for the price they have. You will still hear outside sounds of higher db values, but the noise reduction cancels within a certain range. If you have a crowd around you, with constant chatter, you may need something better. However, these items so far have been superb, simply because the actives work well within a certain range ... check the specs, and check the environment you will be using these headphones in, and if you can, check the db value. Also, thanks to Amazon for making good on USPS's mess up: USPS  claimed to deliver to me  on May 29th ( A Holiday), at 2:40 am... an outright lie. I have had so many problems with USPS  deliveries  from Amazon to me, that if you can, always go for UPS.

"After seeing my 20GB iPod Apple iPod get scratched up, I knew I had to get a case. I went to the nearby electronics store to pick up a case. I saw the DLO Jacket and an iPod hard showcase. In the end, I decided to purchase the DLO Jacket. PROS: *The jacket provides a nice, sturdy for the iPod, leaving it no room for moving, therefore giving a snug fit so you feel it in your hand. *The snug feel gives it more protection in case of a drop. *There is an LCD screen protector built in, so this is excellent. *It looks nice: when you see the iPod in this sleek case for the first time, you'll love it! *Easy accesibility to the click wheel for easy navigation. *Made of durable Neoprane material. CONS: *Hard access to the docking port/Cable Connection port. *Case adds at least 7 ounes to the iPod, making it feel very heavy. *Case adds much thickness; leaving it thicker than the iPod photo. *Case heats up the iPod during long-term charging, Apple recommend you take out the iPod out of the case during charging. *Hard to remove and put in case, I always keep thinking all the shoving will damage the iPod.

"After searching for the perfect seat, we realized this is the most perfect one there is for now.  Britax is safety-conscious, has great customer service, and this seat is NICE.  I got it on sale for 200 somewhere else online, because the fabric was being discontinued (a savings of $88.00!).  The firefighter who helped me install it was impressed with the side head protectors built in.  We were able to adjust the seat in all areas easily. Making sure to put the seatbelt through the side hole, under the seat padding, behind and around the crotch latch, then out the other hole was something I didn't get from the picture, though.  Knowing this seat can hold my child up to 65 lbs. is great because I have a larger child. I should've gotten this one from birth and saved the money on the infant snugli carrier.  It was rear-facing even as my child was 23 pounds and only 9 months old.  It fits tight and perfect in the passenger sideboard position, but if I were more persistent and industrious, I might be able to figure out how to get it to fit in the middle position (I have a 2000 Blazer and the firefighter and I couldn't get it to fit tightly because the two seatbelt latches are not far enough apart in the middle, so the seat sits on top of them-not safe).  My car does not have latch, but the latch connectors would be useful if for a different car.  The side head protectors are NOT a problem, and since my son is young enough, he won't know what piece of view is missing because he'll be used to the seat and won't remember any differently.  I feel this seat is the safest and am completely confident in it.  (Now if I could just keep my lead foot in check, we'll be even safer)AN UPDATE: My son is now 15 months old, 28 lbs. extremely tall, and the side head guard grows easily with him--its sooo easy to turn the nob every few weeks. He sleeps easily with head rested against the sides and shows no signs of feeling 'restrained'. I still have peace of mind, and since I have another boy on the way, I will be buying another one soon!",10/23/2005,1.0,1.0,A1EYGMU277OEHX,B0002XO5NS,5.0,1.0,738426.0,26.0,Peace of Mind (and a year later no problems),0.0,0,3885,-,0.0,Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,PackageDimensions,Binding->Baby Product,ProductGroup->Baby Product,EAN->0652182051891,Title->Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC->652182051891,,,,
"After seeing the picture postcard like LCD displays in many stores, I fianlly gave in to the temptation of buying a HD LCD tv - and what a tv it is! I am glad I listened to my friend who has had this set for a year and a half. Was surprised to see the rating that this tv has on amazon. Looking closer, I found that some of the negative rating were for other Panasonic tv's and not this one. A goof up somewhere. Singling out any one feature may do injustice to the many this one has to offer. Let me explain each on its own merit: 1. Picture: First thing that would bowl anyone out is the picture quality - crisp picture, great rich colors, excellent contrast, just too pleasing to the eyes. To compare the video from different sources: a. HD Cable channels: This tv enhanced the clarity of the HD channels even further, when comparing to some of the pictures I have seen in TV stores. b. Standard TV channels: The TV has a ""normal"" video mode for watching standard width format SDTV programs. Standard TV channels look very preety good on this TV, easily comparable to my old Sony Trinitron. Room Lighting effect: The TV has 3 main preset modes for different lighting conditions. Vivid is great in a well lit room. The  Normal mode is good in ""drawing room"" dimly lit conditions. The cinema mode brings home the theatre in low light conditions. Plus, the TV has good manual setting controls to change the picture ""look"" as per user tastes. 2. Sound: After setting this TV up, I did not feel the need for connecting my Onkyo speakers for a month after listening to the surprisingly good sound from this set. With the speakers lying around and the availability of so many slots for hooking these up behind the TV set, I did make the connection. Luckily my neighbours are on vacation. 3. Looks: The TV, with the matching stand looks stunning. With its low depth, it is as good as a flat panel TV for people who do not want to hang it on the wall. 4. Remote: The remote is very easy to use and has a lot of controls on it. It was easy for my fingers to get used to this one after being trained to use the Sony for so many years. 5. Controls: The TV has manual and auto channel tuning. You would love the search option where by it keeps showing a small window of 3 channels on the side which playing the cahnnel you want to see on the big part of the screen. Thus I do not miss any action while watching the TV guide for what's next! 6. Connectivity: It is easy to hook up the HD box, computer, DVD player, Tivo Xbox and everything else together on this box. It has multiple s-video, component and composite slots. The TV offers these video connect options to connect the source to the TV. These are listed below in the order of quality, the best listed first: HDMI SVGA Component S-Video Composite 7. Extras: SVGA cable is inside the pacakage, saves a few good dollars. 8. Bulb Life: A few reviews here said that the bulb has a short life. They have mentioned a differnt TV model and not this one. Mine has been good since I bought it and my friend has not had to replace it for 18 months now. 9. Computer monitor: I used the SVGA cable to hook my computer to this TV. With a wireless mouse/keyboard set, am able to use my computer without moving a muscle. What I love even more is that I can surf the net and watch my favourite sport together on the same huge screen.

"After seeing the majority of favorable reviews for these, I bought them.  A huge mistake.  I have now burned 6 of the 50 as music CDs using my computer.  The first three were given to a friend to play in her car -- none of the three would play.  I burned the other three for myself.  Although the CDs would play, some of the songs had a strange type of ""interference"" sound.  It seemed to come up only on certain songs, and only in certain parts of the songs.  Nonetheless, it is sufficiently distracting that neither I nor my kids want to listen to these CDs, which are all going to be thrown away.  Although I should return the spindle (given that I'm batting 0 for 6), the hassle of packaging it and mailing it back isn't worth the time this will take, so I guess I'll just ""eat"" the $20.

"After searching near and far to replace my Panasonic showstopper 2000 (problems with over heating hard drive) I came across an article in Sound and Vision that reviewed the Sharp DV-HR300U.  They gave a very good review of the Sharp and I completely agree with there assessment.  The actual recording on the hard drive looks 10x better then the my old Panasonic. There were only a few quirky things to get used to.  One was that fact that this DVR does not have a menu like Tivo or Replay. You will get a grid  very similar to the Tivo and Replay but there is no listing of the shows.  For me personally it took a little getting used to, kind of had withdrawals. But, once I got past it I was just fine. The Sharp DV-HR300U comes with its own tuner so you can watch your own TV and record on separate channel. BUT **BIG BUT*  if you have cable as I do and your premium channels are 99 and higher then you need to get a little creative.  I had to keep in mind that Sharp made the DV-HR300U more like a VCR then a PVR.  So on my cable box I used the component out for the component in on the Sharp DV-HR300U and record directly off the cable box. I leave the Sharp DV-HR300U on channel three and my cable box on the channel that it needs to record.  Sounds like a pain in the but.. HUH!  Well I would agree with you. and I was ready to return it, until I discovered that my cable box has a channel timer.  Now I  simply set the cable box to switch to the channels I want, at the time I want and set the Sharp DV-HR300U to record at that time and I have my personal clone of Tivo/ Replay type of  user friendly menu. Like I said if it were not for the fact that my cable box would  switch channels for me I would not have kept it.  And that would have been a real shame, because this thing puts out some awesome pictures.  I also like the fact that I am not paying Tivo and Replay the $200.00 life time or $14.99 monthly service to record.  It's a give and take.  =) One last thing to review is the dvd recording.  Simply put its looks great.  Don't expect some of the older dvd players to be able to play the DVD-R or RW.  I nor any of my family or friends had to worry about it because we had dvd players that were fairly new and played the whatever I had recorded.  The software is bit technical but once you understand it you will have no problems.  I have even uploaded home movies that I recorded on my sony digital camcorder.  It's a nice touch to be able to put those home made movies on dvd.. I hope this review helped and with these parting words I recommend it highly as long you can meet the same needs that I had.  good luck ....",5/4/2004,68.0,66.0,AG2RJLFKCJFUU,B0001ZROQM,4.0,0.0,758335.0,21.0,Sharp DV-HR300U  review,0.0,0,37087,Sharp,799.99,Sharp DV-HR300U DVD Player/Recorder with 80-GB Drive,Binding->Electronics,BatteriesIncluded->1,Brand->Sharp,Batteries->2,EAN->0074000354364,ItemDimensions,Label->Sharp,"LegalDisclaimer->****Brand New - Factory Sealed! ***Ships via UPS with Tracking info!*** No HI, AK, APO please without additional freight charges.

"After some moron (me) thoughtlessly downloaded some spyware (the website I went to said it couldn't run without a plug-in that allowed the page to display correctly - this was the spyware, I found out later), I was left with a ton of spyware programs, which proceeded to not only re-direct my browser to God knows where, but also to call back to the mothership and bring in even more software - bypassing the firewall on my machine, no less. So, I bought this software on the recommedation of another, and I must say it's an excellent product. Installation was simple, and it immediately initiated a scan of the system, detecting some 13 instances of spyware installed, and 6 distinct individual types of spyware. It even provided quite a bit of detail on the spyware detected, who makes it, who distributes it, etc. It went on to clean my system, warning me about potential problems with removing some of the components, and making suggestions for action. My only potential 'criticism' of the product is that, at the very beginning, the interface is a little manic (for lack of a better word) - several windows pop up simultaneously, each asking for direction, or to inform me of a new detection, or to tell me some other stuff I can't even remember now. I found this more amusing than anything, and I thought it showed that the makers of this software were enthusiastic about the product, if nothing else. But, after the initial scan, all you ever see is a window asking if it can call home to get updates, and a request to scan the system for spyware. So, overall, if you are looking for a solid anti-spyware program, I would highly recommend this one.",4/25/2004,29.0,27.0,A22RQSV6S49T58,B0001MBCI6,5.0,1.0,763128.0,11.0,Nothing if not enthusiastic.,0.0,0,6783,FBM Software,29.99,Zero Spyware 2004,EAN->0821681032124,Binding->CD-ROM,Feature->Detects and eliminates spyware,Brand->Global Marketing Partners,Feature->Protects against web identity theft,ListPrice,Manufacturer->FBM Software,Model->2131813,MPN->zs-1004,NumberOfItems->1,PackageDimensions,Platform->Windows 98,Platform->Windows 95,Platform->Windows XP,Platform->Windows Me,Platform->Windows 2000,Feature->Prevents hijacking of your personal files,Feature->Stops spies from monitoring your keystrokes,Feature->Blocks malicious cookies,Format->CD-ROM,Label->FBM Software
"After searching for some time for a good piano tutorial software I ended up at Best Buy and, almost by accident, came across Interactive Keyboard written by Laurie Arthur. As a disclaimer, I am in no way tied to the promoter or the promotion of this product. My previous exposure to piano was limited to a group piano course at a junior college and some self-training, specifically with the old Miracle Piano Teaching System which is now obsolete. I have been working with the program for a few days now and I believe I am developing solid technique beyond my prior education. The initial setup was tricky (program loaded fine on Windows '98SE but I needed a MIDI in/out cable-to-USB to hook up my antiquated Kawai KC10 Spectra synthesizer in addition to having to download a driver for the cable hookup, although any modern keyboard should adapt just fine) but once I got rolling I found the program both intuitive and fun. The software package comes with a 222 page manual that is simply loaded with valuable information on technique, music theory, improvisational methods, proper form and exercises, and a host of other information, as well as ""Fifty Famous Feels""; a variety of samples of music in different styles one can playback and with which one can play along. The program seems geared toward the adult learner who is intent on getting a grasp of the piano in an accelerated fashion, though a bright child with some keyboard skills could benefit as well. From the beginning, the program sets out what is required of the student and provides ample exercises at increasingly difficult levels, along with a ""Comp-u-Pare"" facility that enables one to record the recital of exercises (with or without the accompanying backtrack/rhythm) and test her/his skills and abilities. In addition, the software features musical notation of the exercises, a visual/virtual ""keyboard"" that plays the exercise, text explanations of the lessons (mirrored in the manual), and videos that show how to play the exercises. There is more (including MIDI interface tools which I have yet to explore) but I can safely say this is one of the best programs available if one wishes to apply the learning methods to gain a solid understanding of the keyboard at a self-paced level. The writer(s) of this program have clearly done their homework in presenting the student with a valuable tool for grasping musical knowledge best presented on the piano keyboard. However, the instruction seems to go beyond the stoic, stodgy feel of personal piano lessons and slow-paced tutorial softwares into the realm of developing the keyboard player as a MUSICIAN and gaining the ""feel"" of what it is like to control the instrument instead of letting it dictate your actions and feelings.

"After seeing it up-close in BRU, I registered for it and recieved it! *** Just a side note, we purchased this swing NOT as an entertainment one, but as a soothing one. We own a travel swing for entertainment *** PROS - The extra infant support. My now 5 month old was premature so this was helpful, and makes it more comfortable! - I love the cradle motion, as does my son. We never really liked the back and fort until around 3 months old, so this was really the only option. - I like the mirror, as does my baby (its a dome, so they really DO get a nice view!) - the mobile is great too, as the birds spin and rotate, and the leaves go up and down and rotate! - the music is calm and soothing. There are also a few volume settings - the removable tray bar has a few toys, which is hard to find in a swing - there are two possitions, reclined, or fully upright. My son now likes the fully upright most of the time - its very stable and adorable! - THE MOTOR IS SO QUIET! I cannot believe people saying otherwise, sometimes you cannot even tell that the swing is moving if the music isnt on! CONS - The mobile is fantastic, but after 6-8 minutes it shuts off and I have to push the button again, I wish it could play until you hit an OFF switch! - Sure the papasan folds, but its more so you can get through a door rather than bring it anywhere! It would be a great improvment if the seat could fold sideways (vertically) so it would be more compact - The toys are kinda boring, and oddly placed. I REALLY wish that the toys were removable so I could feed him easier, and so I could place my own toys on - the swing warrnets a fair chunk of my family room/den! - When the baby was under 2 months, the lowest setting still went a bit fast (slowed it down with dragging blankets) but this seems relivant with ALL swings. All in all I highly reccomend this product, as it is a GREAT place for baby to sleep and relax. I also reccomend purchasing a more exciting bouncer or travel swing for playtime.",7/19/2005,3.0,3.0,AHW628BU4UMKB,B0001IU5HY,5.0,0.0,765418.0,993.0,A wonderful product!,0.0,0,5,Fisher Price,129.99,Baby Papasan Cradle Swing,Binding->Baby Product,BatteriesIncluded->0,Brand->Fisher Price,Batteries->4,EAN->0027084143416,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Fisher Price,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Fisher Price,Model->G2609,MPN->G2609,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->Baby Product,Publisher->Fisher Price,Feature->The nest-like seat comfortably cradles baby in soft multi-textured materials,"Feature->A removable toy bar with a fun toy, bead bars, and a tray space provides activities for baby","Feature->The swing features 6 speeds, 8 soothing songs, soothing nature sounds,infant head support insert, 2 position seat recline and folds for storage",Feature->Fisher Price Babygear Specialty Swing,Feature->Age Range Birth to 2 Years

"After some research and few friend's recommendation, I decided on PIX 501.  It's the lowest model of PIX from Cisco (which fits our small company's need), but it has the same technology of Stateful Packet Inspection as other Cisco Firewall, except at a lower bandwidth. I'm not a network admin, so I didn't know that with a firewall, I need to change all public IP to internal IP in order for it work.  Since this particular PIX doesn't do layer 2 conversion.  So I got my work cut out for me to migration over 50 machines to internal IP, well, it's for the best security anyway.  Should have been done a long time ago before I inherit the network.  Firewall rules are pretty simple, similar to Cisco router ACL.  I wanted to use the GUI, but my friends were against it, they said it's pretty weak.  They're right, command line is better, but nevertheless, I tried the GUI (PDM), it's not bad to see some graphs but for some feature I think it's less confusing using command line.  PDM is written in Java but Java 1.5 won't work, some compatibility issue, you have to use Java 1.4.  I found this out the hard way. It's got some pretty nice feature because of packet inspection, like it checks for ftp command, so bad commands to ftp port gets block.  This will block hacker from hacking using bug inside the FTP server.  Also for FTP, it takes care of ftp ports usage (port 20, 21), none of these active/passive issues.  Passive FTP works w/ firewall, but if both side has firewall w/ high ports blocked, then ftp will have problem.  But the PIX takes care of that issue. Overall, it's a solid firewall, haven't had any trouble with it once it's setup.  Pretty happy with it.  And the unlimited licenses means unlimited IP internally, so we don't have to worry about the license issue.",6/29/2005,4.0,2.0,A2X4IDASPMOM3S,B0000A4F2Y,5.0,0.0,793831.0,1.0,Great Firewall,0.0,0,58867,CISCO SYSTEMS - ENTERPRISE,1410.23,Cisco Syst.

"After so many months of use, I could say this router is right on the money. I had to restart it maybe once a month or less, though the root cause might have been the DSL modem. It's been working well in a mixed environment--different OSes, card adapters, etc.. For those of you who have PPPoE networks, this router works indeed very well (INSTALL INCLUDED). Get as fast as you can to the web interface and drive things from there--security, firmware updates, monitoring, etc. And now, a word of caution: do not trust 100% the built-in firewall. There have indeed been 5 or 6 attacks, over 9 months of use, detected by the software firewall I kept. So, to address this issue, keep all firewalls running and up to date.

"AFter seeing the mix review I decided to get couple to check the light out since it's only $21 to $23.  The light looks good both black and silver color.  At this price I didn't expect much, the Xenon light is definitly brighter than the Maglight even though the quality of the beam is not as good as Surefire or UltraStinger.  3 LED is bright enough that you can probably see it miles away or light up the walking trail at night.  At 28 hrs for the LED it's a good emergency light.

"After seeing and using so many cloth covered high chairs, one would think that a leather covered high chair would be great.  It should contain foods that are dropped by new eaters and wipe off easily.  As I said, in theory, it's great.  However, the design of the high chair is greatly lacking. This design has a hole in the leather for the bar that is designed to prevent your child from sliding out under the tray.  It also has a design in which the leather comes together in the back, bottom corners.  Because the leather comes together from two pieces, this leave a gap/slit that allows food to be pushed or to fall under the leather padding.  These two holes have been the most irritating, agitating part of owning this high chair. We live in a climate in which we keep our windows open all of the time.  Because of this, small little creatures can get into our home---namely fruit flies and gnats.  These lovely gaps in our $180 high chair have created a breeding ground for these bugs!  We are not dirty people and I clean out the crevices in this high chair after every use.  But, since food falls under the seat, I am having a hard time cleaning it thoroughly after each use. I called PP today to ask about what they suggested to prevent this.  They told me that I should reasonably be expected to remove the screws, pull out the straps and seat belts, thoroughly clean, then replaces everything--including the screws AFTER EVERY MEAL.  Then, I was told that perhaps if I were a little cleaner, I wouldn't get bugs.  So much for customer service!  I don't know anyone with a small child who would think this is a reasonable way to design OR clean a product that you use at least 3-5 times a day! I suggest buying a less expensive seat--perhaps one that can be popped in the dish washer... or even one of those old fashioned wooden ones.  We're currently in the market for one to replace ours--and I can't, in good conscious pass this bug growth zone on to another unsuspecting parent!  So, I'll be throwing it out.",8/30/2004,2.0,1.0,A1ISP3HCYGI417,B000087L1H,1.0,1.0,827997.0,8.0,"Great in Theory, Poor in Design",0.0,0,3202,Peg Perego,0.0,Peg Perego Prima Pappa Multi-Position Leatherette High Chair - Tan,EAN->0016337360892,Binding->Baby Product,ItemDimensions,Brand->Peg Perego,Label->Peg Perego,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->Baby Product,Publisher->Peg Perego,Studio->Peg Perego,Title->Peg Perego Prima Pappa Multi-Position Leatherette High Chair - Tan,UPC->016337360892,VariationDescription->Tan,,,,,Manufacturer->Peg Perego,ManufacturerMaximumAge->36,ManufacturerMinimumAge->6,MPN->IMPPLIUS26QL46,NumberOfItems->1

"After seeing this toy in a store and commenting how my daughter would probably love it (she was, and still is, highly into rattles and anything that's easy to grasp), my in-laws purchased this as a gift.  She was 6 months then, and now she'll be a year next week and it's still one of her favorite toys.  She has another like this that has a duck in the middle and, despite her love of all things ducky, she completely ignores it in favor of this one. It's very durable, easy for little hands to grasp, and it seems to feel good on her gums as she likes to chew on it.
