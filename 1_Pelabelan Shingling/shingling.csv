"We recently got DirecTV after seeing their ad blitz for 75 HD channels.  They brag about their ""digital picture and sound,"" and their great customer service. The truth is the only way to get digital picture and sound is with a HDTV and an HDMI.  Their picture is actually worse than the picture we got with Comcast.  Not to mention there is no two year agreement with cable, no picture loss when it rains, you do not have to pay for ""leased equipment, and you do not need an ugly dish hanging on your house. When we purchased our most recent HDTV, we figured we would replace the DVR we had with DirecTV and get an HD DVR to replace it. DirecTV told us we would have to pay $299 for the privlige of leasing their receiver from them.  In addition to this we would have to pay $50 because we were a new customer ""and had not established a credit history with them.""  Also, we would have to pay $20 for shipping and handling and extend our contract for another two years. Maybe DirecTV thinks it is in the cellphone business because all they want to do is lock you into long-term contracts and make you bleed money for them forever.

"If you're reading this.  You are thinking about dropping some serious cash so I will try and help you out! If you're trying to decide between this, which is Adobe production studio premium or the Standard Edition do not buy  The Standard Edition, you get so much more with this version, I repeat do not buy the Standard Edition. You're probably interested in getting the Adobe production studio premium edition.  I have to tell you, this is a great product, the dynamic link is such an amazing feature a links together.  Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe encore, seamlessly.  You can take Adobe After Effects compositions into premiere Pro without rendering.  Then if you need to edit the composition you just pop back into after effects, tweak it adjust it pop back into premiere and is automatically updated.  It is just an amazing thing to see it in action. After effects has got a total facelift, along with encore audition and premiere Pro.  Gone is the ""palette-tosis"" of the old programs.  Where you would lose palettes have palettes on top of palettes not know where to find a palette.  The new facelift is totally awesome. Stability: I've been using these programs for few days, and they are totally stable.  One crash, I think I had and I think was my fault.  Adobe encore, I feel is the best improvements from the old version making a DVD with the new flowchart is so amazingly simple. Adobe After Effects 7.0 after effects is the bomb is you such an amazing program.  Once you get past the user interface and learn some of the nuances you can do almost anything and mean anything with video is awesome.  7.0 has the ton of user presets.  The text effects are great.  The backgrounds that you can create that come as presets, all editable.  A cool thing is with a new user presets, you can see them actually preview and Adobe Bridge.  This is cool! Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 this program now is more in line with user interface from premiere elements.  The one thing I really enjoy now about from your Pro 2.0.  Is that I can import MPEG files from my replay TV and edit them.  This is something that was sorely lacking in from your Pro 1.5 user interfaces been revamped in the new style.  He just feels a lot cleaner smoother and more stable. Adobe audition 2.0 this program, I think has gotten the most drastic user interface upgrade.  I'm not really in the audio is what don't really know what under the hood is changed.  I do know it's got ASIO drivers now.  That is a big deal if you're an audio.  But now the user interface is more in line with all the other a video products.  Was nice about audition now is that if you have a audiophile in premiere Pro 2.0.  You can now send it to audition, change it or modify it save it and it brings it back right into premiere.  No reimporting, that is so cool. Adobe encore 2.0 if you're wondering about Adobe encore this upgrade is nice.  The automatic slideshow creator, while only limited to 99 photos per slideshow is a nice feature.  I'd use it already.  There are some limitations in the slideshow creator like again, only 99 photos per slideshow but you could link unlimited slideshows back to back to back, but you're still limited to 99.  In each slideshow.  Stability I feel in this program is vastly improved the old encore.  I was so like I was teetering on the edge of losing my whole project.  I feel of it safer and encore 2.0.  It has a ton more templates is integration with Adobe Photoshop and with Adobe After effects is amazing.  You will love it! Adobe Bridge 1.0 this program is quirky.  It crashed about 20 times.  It has the potential to be really great, but it's good takes a more time to get there.  Building of this program as your media manager.  Again, it's not there yet.  I'm still using Adobe Photoshop elements, the tagging portion to organize my digital photographs. Adobe dynamic link this program really isn't a program, but it is a program.  If you know and mean?  Basically dynamic link links together all of the applications in the production studio.  Now the hitch is you can't get this if you buy the program separately.  So to see it in action, you have to buy the production studio.  Another reason why you should invest.  But once you have it up and running.  You will be amazed.  It simplifies workflow drastically one place all this in action I bought it enough said. So there you have it my micromini review of Adobe production studio premium.  Something to keep in mind, this does come with a disk of totaltraining that reviews each of the programs give you some of the new features it about two hours.  Not really great but it's free.  When you install it the first time.  You wanna register online seeing a free plug-in are a couple templates that they offer you if you miss this opportunity the first time you install it.  You will not get another chance I believe, so make sure you register. This install comes on five DVDs income of five gigs of loops for Adobe audition, a bunch of DVD templates, and other goodies. Another thing to note, you will not be old to upgrade individual programs.  Once you buy the production studio.  So this means that if a new version of Photoshop CS3 comes out.  You will have to wait to upgrade the production studio.  You can't upgrade individual products.  This kind of rots but I guess you gotta deal. This does have online activation That's all I can think of at the moment, if I think of anything more.  I'll update this review.  Go to Adobe's web site and download the program demos.  The one thing you won't get is dynamic link so you'll have to use your imagination and see how it will fit in.  Also check out the creative cow (dot) com. With the production studio, you also get Adobe Photoshop CS2 in Adobe Illustrator CS2.  That is a huge bonus.

"After reading many reviews of the fm transmittion criteria, I found myself in the market for one. The best reviews that I could find where the Monster IcarPlay (newer) and the Kensington 33185, I could not find either specific model anywhere near me, so I went down to the local bestbuy and got myself the Griffin RoadTrip. I was quite skeptical to see how this would perform because I read many negative reviews regarding Griffin products. After purchasing it for $118 CAD (about $105 US), I went in the car and tried it out. the set up is quite basic and after a few minutes I was listening to my nano with decent sound quality (same as local radio stations). I live in the biggest suburbia in North America, Mississauga, Ontario and the transmittion is quite good. Pros: It does not skip, even as the ipod wiggles from the road bumps It stays in tact Easy to use Good sound quality Comes with everything you need, every ipod model capability Can be used with your PC or Mac to transmit sound for you home stereo Convinient comes with Doc+holder+clip (s) Cons Constant access to the ipod battery could mean that the battery's life is ending faster than it should. the sound quality isn't top notch. (after all it is a transmitter, very minor complaint) Ipod users limit your sounds to minimum when the ipod is playing because it will not have an effect on the transmittion at all. This is probabbly a good thing. Over all I'd like to give it a 5, but 4 seemes more appropriate, due to price and capability. As far as fm transmittion goes this product will not dissapoint you.",5/29/2006,9.0,9.0,A10BM6VYPTXRTN,B000BMXJR8,4.0,0.0,541497.0,270.0,Great product as far as fm transmittion goes...,0.0,1
"After having bought the ""Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod"" (and then promptly returned it because there was just too much static/interference), I decided to try the Griffin RoadTrip.  First, I was shocked at the difference in sound quality between the two products. The Griffin sounds crisp and clear and there is NO static!  I live in Boston and have set the frequency to 88.5 and have not had a single problem.  Second, the Griffin is so much more convenient and easier to use because you just plug it in and turn it on (it remembers whatever frequency you used previously).  No wires, no having to dangle my Nano around the rearview mirror just to get music to play (albeit with frequent static and a constant hissing sound in between songs), and I have a nice, solid, safe place to put my Nano that's right at my fingertips.  My only caution is that the holder-adapter that's designed to fit the Nano will only fit if I take mine out of the leather ""Marware"" protective cover I bought to keep it from getting all scratched up (I have the 2G Black one). An easy solution (at least for me) was to keep my leather cover on and simply use the ""larger"" holder instead of the smaller ""Nano-sized"" one.  Griffin conveniently provides two different thicknesses of padding to customize the fit for virtually all iPods (except the Shuffle, of course) so I just put in one of the pads and my Nano stays nice and secure and will never get scratched.  I highly recommend the RoadTrip and am frankly, shocked that others have rated it so poorly. I love it and could not be happier with my purchase!",1/6/2006,74.0,74.0,ALUSNZATIXQQU,B000BMXJR8,5.0,1.0,541499.0,272.0,Best FM transmitter for iPods on the market!,0.0,1
"After our son out grew his Graco Snug Ride infant car seat. We started to research convertibles car seats. The Britax Marathon's name came up in every online forum as well as writing reviews giving this seat very high ratings. We visited a local store in our area who carried the Britax Marathon as we wanted to see how it would fit our child. We were very pleased that the seat has a growth potential of up to 65 lbs and 49"" in height. This calculates that on average a child can stay in this seat in a five point harness until the approximate age of a five year old.....reassuring. As most seats on the market have five point harnesses that have a weight limit of 40lbs. The Marathon would allow us more long term growth instead of transitioning into a booster early on and bipassing the shoulder/lap belt combination. We shopped online and found that babies r us had a large selection. However the more we researched we found the prices to be considerably lower and made our purchase from travelingtikes.com. They had a great selection as well but the same seat was offered at $219.99 shipping included. Our seat arrived just a short four days later. The Britax's owners manual was easy to read and the seat installation with the LATCH system was simple to install. However I found it a little more difficult TETHER the seat in the rear facing postion. Once installed the seat was very secure and did not have any movement as compared to the our Graco infant seat. Our son seemed to be so happy from the get go. The harnesess were easy to adjust and we liked the fact that there was excellent side wall protection. I especially liked how soft the fabric is to the skin and the belly pad that adds a little extra comfort to the legs from the belt buckle in case it may get hot from direct sun light. We are very happy with our purchase and highly recommend this seat to all.",5/12/2006,6.0,6.0,A2V72OCGSPIRMY,B000AKPE92,5.0,0.0,552592.0,12.0,Worth Every Penny!,0.0,1

"As with any piece of expensive, portable technology, this new iPod requires a hands-on test drive. You need to get a sense as to just how portable it really is, whether it's solid enough for the journey, and, in the case of the iPod with video, just how good the screen really is under various light conditions. I've only had a few moments to check it out, but I'll share my observations. (Having had my nano screen break under normal usage on the very first day I owned it, I brought to the table a real concern about fragility, by the way. Apple, thankfully, replaced the broken nano with a new one, as they have acknowledged an apparent defect with some of the screens.) First, as you would expect, form and fit are first rate. The iPod seems to get smoother and more seamless with each generation. As with the nano, I think the scroll wheel has hit the sweet spot, too. Second, it seems more substantial and durable than the nano. Part of that has to do with the astounding thinness of the nano. There seems to be quite a bit more screen protection inherent in this iPod/video's design (and it is, after, considerably thicker than the nano, but still thin -- the 60 GB version is as thin as the 4th generation's 20 GB model, and the 30 GB is 30% thinner than that). Third, the screen is great. Clear, bright, and easy to read at a range of viewing angles (not that the latter is all that important for most iPods, but video changes all that ...). I must say, however, that it pales in comparison to the Sony PSP's gorgeous widescreen as a platform for watching videos. (The PSP's larger screen is a wonder, both for games and movies. Apple has obviously decided -- at least for the iPod -- to sacrifice optimal screen size for portability. More on that in a second.) Fourth, the slightly sour note. Once you've held the nano, used it, it makes this iPod feel too wide and heavy. Wide to a point where it doesn't easily nestle in the hand. It's the screen, of course, that is responsible. This is where you'll need to pick one up, hold it, check it out. It may be awkward to put in an armband for sports, for example. I found it consmetically less attractive because of that width, but, of course, you'll need to be the judge. Videos look great on it, as do photographs and album art. It's a great platform for catching with Lost -- or Desperate Housewives. But video comes at a price, of course. (Perhaps Apple could have changed the orientation of the screen so as to keep the width in check. Maybe. I'd have preferred that, I think.) The iPod/video is a compromise platform where, as Steve Jobs put it, video is ""icing on the cake."" It may be a bit too much icing for some, given the physical effects it had on design. For those folks, the nano is absolutely perfect, and rumor has it that the nano's capacity will get a jolt upward in the spring if the 2 GB or 4 GB models don't hold enough for your liking.

Avoid RCA DirecTV products like the plague.  We bought a 3-room system and in just under a year one of the receivers died.  On the advice of their customer service (who blamed the problem on DirecTV software) we waited to see if the problem cleared up.  Then they told us it was out of warranty when we later asked for a replacement!  RCA is junk and their service is arrogant and dishonorable.

"As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk. From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist. I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place. And Sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? They are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.

"Apple is, quite simply, the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. A recent article in Consumer Reports identified Apple computers as the most reliable computers and PC Magazine user surveys have reached the same conclusion. Furthermore, PC Magazine regularly designates the iMac G5 as the best all around desktop computer. Now the ultra-reliable, user friendly iMac G5 has an even faster G5 processor. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you really want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based PCs (including regular virus attacks) -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to viruses?

All computers will have 64-bit processors some day but very few PCs, except for Apple G5s, have them at this time.

"After our son out grew his Graco Snug Ride infant car seat. We started to research convertibles car seats. The Britax Marathon's name came up in every online forum as well as writing reviews giving this seat very high ratings. We visited a local store in our area who carried the Britax Marathon as we wanted to see how it would fit our child. We were very pleased that the seat has a growth potential of up to 65 lbs and 49"" in height. This calculates that on average a child can stay in this seat in a five point harness until the approximate age of a five year old.....reassuring. As most seats on the market have five point harnesses that have a weight limit of 40lbs. The Marathon would allow us more long term growth instead of transitioning into a booster early on and bipassing the shoulder/lap belt combination. We shopped online and found that babies r us had a large selection. However the more we researched we found the prices to be considerably lower and made our purchase from [...] They had a great selection as well but the same seat was offered at [...] shipping included. Our seat arrived just a short four days later. The Britax's owners manual was easy to read and the seat installation with the LATCH system was simple to install. However I found it a little more difficult TETHER the seat in the rear facing postion. Once installed the seat was very secure and did not have any movement as compared to the our Graco infant seat. Our son seemed to be so happy from the get go. The harnesess were easy to adjust and we liked the fact that there was excellent side wall protection. I especially liked how soft the fabric is to the skin and the belly pad that adds a little extra comfort to the legs from the belt buckle in case it may get hot from direct sun light.

"A Norton AV user for years, the upgrade to 2005 made sense.  Actually bought a 3-user package for my household's 3 PCs.  On 2 PCs, it slowed the PCs down considerably and causes system crashes on one. On the 3rd PC, it installed and activated fine, but the subscription expired (actually a previous version's subscription expired, not the current one, but it did not know that).  Re-installation did not work - activation of the software told me that the CD KEY is invalid (after long, long waits for the activation to run).  Symantec online diagnostics did not help.  Tech support performed an ""over the phone"" activation.  A few days later, the software said its trial period has ended and ceased to work.  Tech support (again) told me they would email me instructions that would definitely restore the software and 1 year subscription.  They never sent the email. Ultimately, I purchased another brand of AntiVirus software and will be asking for some money back from Norton (although I know that they will tell me I have to go back to the store I bought it from - too late for that). In summary, Notron 2005's performance reminds me of, well, like a virus on my PCs.  They've lost a long-time customer.

"Anyone considering purchasing this or any Archos product should be aware that based on my experience (4 Archos jukeboxes) their quality control is spotty at best. This used to be bearable because they used to have a fairly liberal warranty policy and would repair or exchange defective products no questions asked. That has changed. Now you have to go through an elaborate process of providing documentation of purchase, mailing the unit back at your own expense, insured, and waiting in silence while they decide what to do. In my case the little joystick that is the key control of the AV320 fell off. When I returned the unit to them for repair (they would not simply send me the part) they decided to keep the 80 gb hard drive I had installed in my AV320. Because they claim installing the drive voided the warranty they now say that they will not return MY drive to me unless I pay them $125 for the repair. Won't take back the replacement they sent me, won't send me a replacement part, won't give me my property back. Worst customer service I've ever seen.

"As an engineer, consultant, businessman, and educator- pramatism (bang per buck) absolutely rules. No question- having suffered dozens of daily crashes with the latest PCs and Microsoft software, hundreds of OS updates, crippled unreliable Dell and IBM laptops (yet working in aerospace, space and formula one)- I am so P**sed off with the quality (lack thereof) in IT (17 years worth!)....Count the hours wasted and dollars spent on software... To the new Apple- within 5 minutes it was connected to the Internet, talking with all the printers, scanners, faxes, gamespads, videocams without any hitch whatsoever (REAL WOW). OK so OSX looks scary- 30 minutes to get used to without even looking at the straightfoward manual. Appleworks free office suite reads all my papers and articles without a glitch even though they were written (and crashed) in MS Office. Some software updates- quick with a disk optimiser automatically (no fragmented disks..). Speedwise an iMac G5 1.6/ 512MB RAM/160 GB HD/17 screen boots up and feels about 3 x faster than a Dell Inspiron Laptop/Pentium 4 1.6/512MB RAM/30GB HD/16VRAM/15 Screen. Never mind the cool factor or that an equivalent Dell costs more.. I even have to move my head from side to side as the screen is so big! Moans- more power would be great (e.g. better graphics card options, dual processor option) but in reality the iMac is such such a marvel of industrial design in the true sense, doesn/t crash all day, and works very effectively at a great price. BTW I did a factory 1 slot 512MB option so that could 3rd party upgrade another 512 more cost effectively- but am told that the 2 slots do not need to match in size. Overall- a real winner- My *New* Dell laptop has become a paperweight holding a cable! UPDATE (a few days later)- everyone who has seen and used the new iMac wants one; I *want to* use the computer (fun!) rather than dread it (Windows); think that office productivity - languishing despite vast IT investments- may rebound if coporations were brave enough to invest in one of these for all staffers... (not one crash in 40 hours use- a record!!!). BTW may start to put in some industrial strength engineering modelling apps soon (with a second new Mac- a Dual PowerMac 3GHz when it comes)...

"After I reviewed the review from other users, I can see that some users have problems on using this media but no one has provide any solution to resolve that.  Since I have no problem on using this media with my Sony DW-D26A DVD burner, I would like to share some of my experience with others. Both my Panasonic and Toshiba DVD player do not support DVD+R format.  After reading an article about changing booktype bitsettings, I tried to use K-probe v.2.4.2 (freeware)along with Nero 6.6.0.8, I was even able to change the booktype setting and made this disc read on my DVD player as DVD-ROM, not DVD+R. Both my DVD players played the disc fine. I even tried these burnt disc on a few of my friends DVD players such as Apex, Sony and JVC and the playback was flawless. I do not have any problem on burning these discs at 8x speed with my Sony DW-D26A.  My friend borrowed a few of this blank discs from me to backup some of his home movies on his older model Sony DW-D22A and he was able to burn it at 8x speed as well. A suggestion to other users with old model of DVD burner that you may have to check the official site of your DVD burner to get the up-to-date patch since the latest firmware can improve the writing strategy of the DVD burner and it enables your burner to accept more different brand of DVD disc.  :-) If some of you would like to find out more about changing booktype bitsetting, you can check out this link to find out whether your DVD burner would support this technology or not. http://www.k-probe.com",4/19/2005,9.0,7.0,A2YQS8DFQ7NUUU,B0002KQRB4,4.0,0.0,609306.0,39.0,"Good media, if you know what you are doing.",0.0,1
Adobe Premiere  is far from the most advanced non-linear video editing package you can get however let me make this one comment. - Editing is all about cutting and not fancy effects. The strength of the project is what is in front of and behind the camera not fancy effects. I would never recommend using any of the effects on any of the non-linear video editing packages anyway. Get dedicated effects packages if you really want to do your special effects well. In short Adobe Premiere is the BEST cutting software and the EASIEST to use. The learning curve is slightly steep but you will be cutting your footage within a day or two with this one. An editor cuts and arranges media. Adobe Premiere does that perfectly. I recommend this like no other for the price but if you are looking for pro packages then go elsewhere and be prepared to pay five figures with extra hardware. If you want special FX this has some but no pro uses these effects tool. Premiere is a first class cutting tool. Go to Discreet products for FX.,11/8/2004,20.0,19.0,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00021XIZQ,5.0,0.0,620932.0,7.0,Solid Cutting,0.0,1
"After having a Memorex mp3 player die on me in the 4th month, I read a lot of reviews and the Muvo series seemed to get top marks for performance and reliability.  The Muvo Slim even got the top recommendation from a prestigious Consumer technology-review site.  One of the best things about it is the lithium ion rechargeable battery, which even recharges quickly through the USB port.  I went through a lot of batteries before.  Even if your mp3 player gets 10 hours on one battery, if you work out or walk to the bus stop every day, that can mean 1 battery per week -- that starts adding up quickly, believe me! I ended up going for the Muvo Micro instead, but that's only because it has an arm band, and I go running.  I actually like the credit card shape of the Slim better, and it fits excellently in a top pocket.  But I finally got my hands on one in person, and I noticed that the nice leather case doesn't have a place for a belt clip or strap, so even if I had created my own arm strap, there was no place to guide it through.

"A step up adapter is a good tool for getting the most out of your expensive filters. Graduated filters don't work so well using this technique, but imagine using one filter type for multiple thread sized lenses. Step-up rings can also be stacked to get even more use out of a single filter. Keep in mind though that the closer the filter is to the lens, the better the results will be. Another useful feature is that this step-up ring can be used to prevent vignetting. Sometimes a filter can produce vignetting, especially on wide angle lenses. Stacking filters may cause vignetting as well. If using the adapter ring with larger sized filters, the problem may be eliminated as the filter rings are expanded out beyond the lens. This Step-up ring is made of a sold and sturdy but light weight metal construction. I tend to pack a lot of equipment into my camera backpack and carry it all over the place. Not only does this tool reduce my equipment expense, but limits the number of items I carry around. The only problem I've seen with using a step-up adapter is that the lens hood at the same time is pretty much out of the question. This should be expected though as this is a common issue of any step-up ring adapter.

What is a tablet you ask, a tablet is a special type of computer with special software made by Microsoft*** that offers converted handwriting recondition, that means that with a special pen (Included) you can write on the screen press a button and BOOM!!! It converts your handwriting.  As well as offering handwriting recondition it also offers a 14"" screen, something only offered by two manufacturers of tablets (Gateway** and Acer**) in addition it also offers a memory card reader so if you are going on vacation and you're bringing along your digital camera you don't have to pack a cable for your digital camera (if it supports SD, Memory Stick**, or Smart Media) This is why I think the M275 is a excellent system!!!!",6/24/2004,7.0,7.0,A3HX0YP8FY9JHZ,B00015MZSE,4.0,0.0,634556.0,6.0,A Killer Computer,0.0,1

"After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my second favorite. I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates. I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for. The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and 2) the latch mechanism Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate --------------------------------------------- cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36"" Tall / fits 28""-48"" doorway width / 2"" bar to step over / gate opening 19"" -  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal. -  The gate opening is about 19"" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider. -  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it. -  It does come with its own extensions in 5"" and 10"" so it more easily fits the wider doorways. -  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33"" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5"" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75"" as needed). - It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far. I also just like the way the taller gate looks. - It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2"". - If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money. Kidco Center Gateway: --------------------- cost $85 & extensions $24 / gate is 29.5"" Tall / fits 29.25"" to 37.5"" doorway width / 1"" bar to step over / gate opening 22"" - Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22"". (This certainly won points from my 6'2"" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others). I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature. - This one also had the most secure latch feature. You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru. I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out. - This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75"" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75"" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become ""weaker"" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37"" and your door opening is 36.5"", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34""). -  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white. -  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1"" high (seems less of a tripping risk). -  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 8/04) -  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need. -  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up. -  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller. -  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it! First Years - Hands-Free Gate ----------------------------- cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32"" Tall / fits 29""-34"" doorway width / 1.5"" bar to step over / gate opening 17"" - My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17"" wide! I'm 5'8"" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However... - The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width. - Good height to the gate. - It was very sturdy in my doorway. - This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor. - Fits only up to 34"" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension. -  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one. All three gates seemed to: - Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly. - Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall. - Were pretty easy to set up. - All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look ""cheaper"" to me than the others. Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.   Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value.

"As there isn't a version 10 on Amazon.com I had to use this area to warn everyone. I turned on the computer this morning and booted up v. 10 as normal to listen to music while I did my thing. I have the deluxe version of 10 that I paid good money for and was astonished to see this morning that it had expired!!! All of the features that you pay good money for - super tagging etc...will no longer work until I pay them more money?!? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as you won't own the extra features you get over the free version YOU ARE SIMPLY LEASING THEM! Before today I would have given Music Match v. 10 5+ stars as the features are great and the speed is great for use with ripping and relabelling your music collection. As you can see from the other reviews, the On demand junk that they try to get you to pay more money for as well isn't worth anything either. Put simply, DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM MUSIC MATCH!! UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about the deluxe verison expiring as well as put in a report to the Bad Business Bureau. I received a response from Yahoo in response to my complaint to the Better Business Bureau a day later with a new registration key and an apology for the misundstanding (which I have to ask...what misunderstanding?) I sent a reply back asking if the key would expire but have heard nothing back yet (3 business days later). I received an e-mail from the Better Business Bureau today asking me if the problem was resolved because of what they sent me (new registration) I responded by telling them no, it's not resolved because I don't know if the key expires or not. I'll update again once I get a response. **Special Note** If you also plan on filing a complaint to the Better Business Bureau be advised that Yahoo now owns MusicMatch so fill it out with Yahoo's corporate address of 701 First Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1019 with phone number of: 408 349-3300 UPDATE PART 2: I finally received word back from Yahoo customer service that the new key will not expire.

"Anyone considering purchasing this or any Archos product should be aware that based on my experience (4 Archos jukeboxes) their quality control is spotty at best.  This used to be bearable because they used to have a fairly liberal warranty policy and would repair or exchange defective products no questions asked.  That has changed.  Now you have to go through an elaborate process of providing documentation of purchase, mailing the unit back at your own expense, insured, and waiting in silence while they decide what to do.  In my case the little joystick that is the key control of the unit fell off.  When I returned the AV320 to them for repair (they would not simply send me the part) they decided to keep the 80 gb hard drive I had installed in my AV320.  Because they claim installing the drive voided the warranty they now say that they will not return MY drive to me unless I pay them $125 for the repair.  Won't take back the replacement they sent me, won't send me a replacement part, won't give me my property back.  Worst customer service I've ever seen.

Adobe Premiere is far from the most advanced non-linear video editing package you can get however let me make this one comment. - Editing is all about cutting and not fancy effects. The strength of the project is what is in front of and behind the camera not fancy effects. I would never recommend using any of the effects on any of the non-linear video editing packages anyway. Get dedicated effects packages if you really want to do your special effects well. In short Adobe Premiere is the BEST cutting software and the EASIEST to use. The learning curve is slightly steep but you will be cutting your footage within a day or two with this one. An editor cuts and arranges media. Adobe Premiere does that perfectly. I recommend this like no other for the price but if you are looking for pro packages then go elsewhere and be prepared to pay five figures with extra hardware. If you want special FX this has some but no pro uses these effects tool. Premiere is a first class cutting tool. Go to Discreet products for FX.,3/25/2007,2.0,2.0,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000E8JLDA,5.0,0.0,665163.0,11.0,Cut,0.0,1
"Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems. I never tried any recordings using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE.  I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1.  If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture.  This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue.  The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it.  I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card.  I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured.  I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card.  After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card).  BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards.  Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far.  The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).",3/1/2006,16.0,11.0,A1BWFY3BIUP9UF,B000DLBAHI,2.0,1.0,666384.0,4.0,I eventually returned this card due to several problems,0.0,1
"After a year of trying to find a humidifier that works and doesn't break or gets nasty, I will help everyone by giving you my observations.  First we tried those $25 cool mist humidifiers that require the $10 filters/wicks that need replacing every week because they are wrapped up with mold and are loud as an F-15 preparing to take off.  I have tried probably every one there is and at one count I had five different ones.  I don't remember the exact models, but Bemis and Holmes come to mind when I went to search for those always out of stock wicks.  I thought I would go to the warm mist humidifiers because of the apparent purifying of the water through the steaming process, and no wicks.  I put all my humidifiers near a heat/airvent (3'-4' away) approximately 3 feet off the floor on a small table to help dissipate the steam.  My first one of these was the Honeywell HWM450.  I really liked this one right out of the box.  I put it together as described, filled it up with water, set the humidistat to the desired setting and turned it on.  It immediately began spewing out the nice warm steam that the instructions said it would and kept our room (14' X 16') at a nice 45-50% humidity level according to my Oregon Scientific meter.  After every tank full, I would take it apart and inspect the mineral pad and clean or replace it as described.  This thing worked great, good steam, fairly accurate humidity reading (+/- 5%) and automatic operation, no problems until 29 days later (30 day return policy at store I bought it from) when it woke my wife and I from a nice sleep with a putrid plastic burning smell.  I jumped out of bed to see what it was and it was the HWM450.  I unplugged the thing and noticed it was sitting in water.  I took the tank and control unit off to see what was happening.   It appeared as if the heating element came separated from the base and let water seep through to the bottom, almost starting some type of fire or melting process.  I packed it up and took it back to the store where they graciously took it back.  I went to get another just like it thinking this was just a fluke, but luckily they were out and gave me a refund.  I then came to the internet and began searching for others.  Glad I did and read other reviews on this model so tossed out trying to get another.  I then went to Sears and bought a Kenmore 15124 3-gallon warm mist humidifier.  This is the one that needs cloth sleeves that fit over the heating element to absorb the minerals.  I set it up according to the directions and let it run all night.  On high setting, I could never get the room above 30%.  This was futile.  I boxed it up and took it back for a refund the next day.  I may not have given it a fair chance, but even the cool mist humidifiers would get to 35% within 3 hours.  I then found two Honeywell HWM-255's on clearance at the local big box.  I snatched those up and took them home, set them up as instructed by the enclosed book and let them rip.  One immediately started working and the other just sat there with a half working lcd display.  I never got it to work and I took it back.  The other one I set up in our bedroom and noticed the humidistat didn't give an accurate reading as tested with my Oregon Scientific hygrometer.  I did fiddle with it enough to get it to cycle on and off to the level I wanted using my OS hygrometer as a base line.  To get 45-50% humidity in the room, the HWM-255 had to be set on 75%.  Thus far, I like the one that works.  It seems easy enough to clean, no filters, wicks or mineral pads and the reservoir sits nicely upside down when filling.  Just have to wipe off the heating element every filling, but that is cheaper than those filters.  I then decided to get another one for a backup since these things seem to self-destruct regularly. Since I have one that apparently works, I was in no hurry to buy one.  I read some reviews and had a few models in mind and I would investigate them as I saw them in local stores.  I was in a local towel/linen store waiting on my wife one day when I saw a huge amount of steam coming from one corner. This caught my eye since I have been on this humidifier search now for a while.  I walked over and saw several models sitting on a pile of boxes with several TV's playing videos about each one.  After watching these videos on each model displayed, I proceeded to work the knobs and turn various ones on and off, take them apart and look inside them and just gave them a generally good going over.  After digesting all the info I then purchased a Venta Sonic VS100.  I couldn't make myself buy the Air O Swiss one, but if I had not bought so many before, I probably would have.  I took this one home, set it up according to the directions and turned it on.  It didn't take long for it to start working and within two hours, it had the bedroom up to 50% humidity from 30%. Its tank wasn't hard to fill, but it did take a moment to fill up the cartridge where the water fill is so would start letting water down to the heater.  When it reached the desired humidity level, I adjusted the two knobs on it to where it would cycle on and off.  It emptied the tank in one night and I finally got a good night sleep without waking up with dry throat.  This thing just spews out the nice steam/mist profusely.  With all this said, here are a few observations.  1) Don't rely on the built in humidistat (humidity indicator).  Have a separate one to measure your room's humidity.  It is better to have a dial type humidity controller that works than a digital one that doesn't.  2) Cheap prices on these things are not good.  You do get what you pay for.  It seems like the ones that the price started out >$90 is better.  Just buy 1 @ >$100, then 8 @ $30. 3) Keep your receipt and original packaging and buy from a vendor with a good return and customer service policy.  Chances are you'll have to return the cheap ones.  4) These reviews are fairly accurate and are good aids for decision making.  4) Cool mist humidifiers are germ factories.  5) If you buy one that requires replacement filters, cartridges, wicks, make sure they are readily available or stock up when you buy the unit.  6) Place a humidifier off the floor preferably not on top a heat vent and if you have a ceiling fan, turn it on.  7) Don't leave these things running without being watched until you know what they will do.  8) Get one size bigger than what you think you need.  Daily water output is a better indicator than room size capacity.  9) All these things do is introduce water into the air. Warmer air holds water better than cold air.  Old timers used to put a pot of water on their wood stoves to do the same thing.  If you have a wood stove, you don't need a humidifier just more pots of water.  I'll update this as more info comes available.......",2/13/2006,22.0,17.0,ASV2UC0AF1S4Y,B000C1OIJQ,5.0,0.0,671216.0,39.0,So far So good...........,0.0,1

Its tank wasn't hard to fill, but it did take a moment to fill up the cartridge where the water fill is so would start letting water down to the heater.  When it reached the desired humidity level, I adjusted the two knobs on it to where it would cycle on and off.  It emptied the tank in one night and I finally got a good night sleep without waking up with dry throat.  This thing just spews out the nice steam/mist profusely.  With all this said, here are a few observations.  1) Don't rely on the built in humidistat (humidity indicator).  Have a separate one to measure you room's humidity.  It is better to have a dial type humidity controller that works than a digital one that doesn't.  2) Cheap prices on these things are not good.  You do get what you pay for.  It seems like the ones that the price started out >$90 is better.  Just buy 1 @ >$100, then 8 @ $30. 3) Keep your receipt and original packaging and buy from a vendor with a good return and customer service policy.  Chances are you'll have to return the cheap ones.  4) These reviews are fairly accurate and are good aids for decision making.  4) Cool mist humidifiers are germ factories.  5) If you buy one that requires replacement filters, cartridges, wicks, make sure they are readily available or stock up when you buy the unit.  6) Place a humidifier off the floor preferably not on top a heat vent and if you have a ceiling fan, turn it on.  7) Don't leave these things running without being watched until you know what they will do.  8) Get one size bigger than what you think you need.  Daily water output is a better indicator than room size capacity.  9) All these things do is introduce water into the air. Warmer air holds water better than cold air.  Old timers used to put a pot of water on their wood stoves to do the same thing.  If you have a wood stove, you don't need a humidifier just more pots of water.

"As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk. From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist. I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place. Any Sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? They are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.

"Apple is, quite simply, the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. A recent article in Consumer Reports identified Apple computers as the most reliable computers and PC Magazine user surveys have reached the same conclusion. Furthermore, PC Magazine regularly designates the iMac G5 as the best all around desktop computer. Now the ultra-reliable, user friendly iMac G5 has an even faster G5 processor. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you really want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based PCs (including regular virus attacks) -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to viruses? If these virtues are more important to you than being one of the crowd, please seriously consider buying an Apple computer. This new iMac G5 is Apple's latest and fastest iteration of the innovative iMac series of compact, user friendly computers at reasonable prices. Like all G5-powered Apple computers this new iMac is a very fast computer -- more than twice as fast as a Pentium 4 with the same clock speed -- and has a state-of-the-art 64-bit processor. All computers will have 64-bit processors some day but very few PCs, except for Apple G5s, have them at this time. If you're looking for a fast, versatile, easy to use computer, want to stop worrying abut virus attacks, and are willing to try something off the beaten path, you'll love this elegant and now faster new iMac G5.

"Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund. I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).",3/14/2006,13.0,10.0,A1BWFY3BIUP9UF,B0006G33UW,2.0,1.0,722892.0,18.0,I eventually returned this tuner card due to several problems.,0.0,1
"After having a Memorex mp3 player die on me in the 4th month, I read a lot of reviews and the Muvo series seemed to get top marks for performance and reliability. The Muvo Slim even got the top recommendation from a prestigious Consumer technology-review site. One of the best things about it is the lithium ion rechargeable battery, which even recharges quickly through the USB port. I went through a lot of batteries before. Even if your mp3 player gets 10 hours on one battery, if you work out or walk to the bus stop every day, that can mean 1 battery per week -- that starts adding up quickly, believe me! I ended up going for the Muvo Micro instead, but that's only because it has an arm band, and I go running. I actually like the credit card shape of the Slim better, and it fits excellently in a top pocket. But I finally got my hands on one in person, and I noticed that the nice leather case doesn't have a place for a belt clip or strap, so even if I had created my own arm strap, there was no place to guide it through.

"After reading many reviews of the fm transmittion criteria, I found  myself in the market for one. The best reviews that I could find where the Monster IcarPlay (newer) and the Kensington 33185, I could not find either specific model anywhere near me, so I went down to the local bestbuy and got myself the Griffin RoadTrip. I was quite skeptical to see how this would perform because I read many negative reviews regarding Griffin products. After purchasing it for $118 CAD (about $105 US), I went in the car and tried it out. the set up is quite basic and after a few minutes I was listening to my nano with decent sound quality (same as local radio stations). I live in the biggest suburbia in North America, Mississauga, Ontario and the transmittion is quite good. Pros: It does not skip, even as the ipod wiggles from the road bumps It stays in tact Easy to use Good sound quality Comes with everything you need, every ipod model capability Can be used with your PC or Mac to transmit sound for you home stereo Convinient comes with Doc+holder+clip (s) Cons Constant access to the ipod battery could mean that the battery's life is ending faster than it should. the sound quality isn't top notch. (after all it is a transmitter, very minor complaint) Ipod users limit your sounds to minimum when the ipod is playing because it will not have an effect on the transmittion at all. This is probabbly a good thing. Over all I'd like to give it a 5, but 4 seemes more appropriate, due to price and capability.

"After having bought the ""Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod"" (and then promptly returned it because there was just too much static/interference), I decided to try the Griffin RoadTrip. First, I was shocked at the difference in sound quality between the two products! The Griffin sounds crisp and clear and there is NO static! I live in Boston and have set the frequency to 88.5 and have not had a single problem. Second, the Griffin is so much more convenient and easier to use because you just plug it in and turn it on (it remembers whatever frequency you used previously). No wires, no having to dangle my Nano around the rearview mirror just to get music to play (albeit with frequent static and a constant hissing sound in between songs), and best of all, I now have a nice, solid, safe place to put my Nano that's right at my fingertips. My only caution is that the holder-adapter that's designed to fit the Nano will only fit if I take mine out of the leather ""Marware"" protective cover I bought to keep it from getting all scratched up (I have the 2G Black one). An easy solution (at least for me) was to keep my leather cover on and simply use the ""larger"" holder instead of the smaller ""Nano-sized"" one. Griffin conveniently provides two different thicknesses of padding to customize the fit for virtually all iPods (except the Shuffle, of course) so I just put in one of the pads and my Nano stays nice and secure and will never get scratched. I highly recommend the RoadTrip and am frankly, shocked that others have rated it so poorly.

"A Norton AV user for years, the upgrade to 2005 made sense. Actually bought a 3-user package for my household's 3 PCs. On 2 PCs, it slowed the PCs down considerably and causes system crashes on one. On the 3rd PC, it installed and activated fine, but the subscription expired (actually a previous version's subscription expired, not the current one, but it did not know that). Re-installation did not work - activation of the software told me that the CD KEY is invalid (after long, long waits for the activation to run). Symantec online diagnostics did not help. Tech support performed an ""over the phone"" activation. A few days later, the software said its trial period has ended and ceased to work. Tech support (again) told me they would email me instructions that would definitely restore the software and 1 year subscription. They never sent the email. Ultimately, I purchased another brand of AntiVirus software and will be asking for some money back from Norton (although I know that they will tell me I have to go back to the store I bought it from - too late for that).

As well as offering handwriting recondition it also offers a 14? screen, something only offered by two manufacturers of tablets (Gateway** and Acer**) in addition it also offers a memory card reader so if you are going on vacation and you?re bringing along your digital camera you don?t have to pack a cable for your digital camera (if it supports SD, Memory Stick**, or Smart Media) This is why I think the M275 is a excellent system!!!!",6/21/2004,15.0,8.0,A3HX0YP8FY9JHZ,B00025C17S,4.0,0.0,754253.0,1.0,A Killer Computer,0.0,1
"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year.  They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties.

"After reading the reviews on both, I was undecided whether to buy the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Champ. So I bought both and tried them side-by-side. I got the Genie on sale for $19, plus the an extra insert for $5. I bought the Champ for $25 after a $5 coupon. I brought them home and first set up the Genie for it's two-week test run. I loved it. Since it seals each diaper individually, you don't have to throw out a whole bag for a few days worth of diapers. And yes, you'll want to empty it out every three to four days. But that's no problem: press the cut button, give it a turn, two at the most, take the unit to the garbage and open the bottom. The sausage links fall out and you tie up the top again. Easy, clean, no need to mess with the diapers themselves. Then I set up the Champ. It almost got boxed up its first day. It did almost nothing to control the smell. So I emptied it out and exchanged it, thinking I must have bought a defective one. Nope. The next one was just as bad. I could smell the first messy diaper immediately. Essentially, it's a trash can with an allegedly smell proof lid, but it can't even accomplish that. Then when it's time to empty it out, you are back to emptying a trash can, which means opening the lid, exposing the diapers to the air, and throwing out an essentially empty garbage bag. You will change the bag every day or two. It smells bad. Very. So it's all well and fine that you can use any suitably sized trash bag in it, but you'll go through them that much faster, too. To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it. One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods. The Champ may be nice for newborns with their odorless diapers, since all you have to do is insert diaper and flip the handle, but in my opinion, by the time your kids get to solid foods and the resulting odor, stick with the Genie.",2/5/2006,8.0,7.0,A2B05PNA67H4IJ,B0001NE8OA,4.0,1.0,762027.0,185.0,Genie v.

"As there isn't a version 10 on Amazon.com I had to use this area to warn everyone.  I turned on the computer this morning and booted up v. 10 as normal to listen to music while I did my thing.  I have the deluxe version of 10 that I paid good money for and was astonished to see this morning that it had expired!!!  All of the features that you pay good money for - super tagging etc...will no longer work until I pay them more money?!?  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as you won't own the extra features you get over the free version YOU ARE SIMPLY LEASING THEM!  Before today I would have given Music Match v. 10 5+ stars as the features are great and the speed is great for use with ripping and relabelling your music collection.  As you can see from the other reviews, the On demand junk that they try to get you to pay more money for as well isn't worth anything either.  Put simply, DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM MUSIC MATCH!! UPDATE:  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about the deluxe verison expiring as well as put in a report to the Bad Business Bureau.  I received a response from Yahoo in response to my complaint to the Better Business Bureau a day later with a new registration key and an apology for the misundstanding (which I have to ask...what misunderstanding?)  I sent a reply back asking if the key would expire but have heard nothing back yet (3 business days later).  I received an e-mail from the Better Business Bureau today asking me if the problem was resolved because of what they sent me (new registration)  I responded by telling them no, it's not resolved because I don't know if the key expires or not.  I'll update again once I get a response.  **Special Note** If you also plan on filing a complaint to the Better Business Bureau be advised that Yahoo now owns MusicMatch so fill it out with Yahoo's corporate address of 701 First Ave, Sunnyvale, CA  94089-1019 with phone number of: 408 349-3300 UPDATE PART 2:  I finally received word back from Yahoo customer service that the new key will not expire.

"After reading many mixed reviews of this dish I'm glad I finally just went ahead and ordered it. It is such a nice design - handsome and clean lines with great colors, it makes my whole kitchen look and feel a little bit 'cutting edge' or 'modern' (I'm not kidding, even my husband thinks this set is ""cool"") and the spoons are my baby's favorite (he's 7 months old) My 2 and 3 year old toddlers like to use the spoons too! I am writing to clear up a few misconceptions that other reviewers had mentioned; here's what I found: first of all, my set came with two spoons in different colors and one bowl. The bowl and the rim are separate pieces that snap together too firmly for baby to take apart, but might come apart if the bowl hits the floor like ours did (but it did not break and I can't imagine that it ever will). The rim is sort of rubbery and skid-resistant, the plastic bowl hangs suspended from the rim and the 'splayed' design of the rim allows for a lot of baby's reaching in and pushing food around and out without it tipping. This is not the case with 'normal'/traditional bowl-shaped baby dishes which tilt, rock, roll and then go spinning off the highchair tray. It's not tip-proof, it does not suction to the tray and your baby will eventually figure out how to pick it up. But, even after my little guy figured all that out, he still seems more interested in chasing his food around and then victoriously jamming it into his mouth with the sloping sides of the dish really helping him to get the job done. (He's still using his fingers at this point, the spoon is for me to help him right now). You can wash this in a dishwasher (yay!) you can use it in a microwave too (yay!) but take care never to 'boil' the food, just zap very briefly to gently warm up cold mac-n-cheese, for example. (The lable warns not to exceed 194 degrees). The spoons are wonderful; hard plastic with a rounded edge (that is gentle on baby's still toothless gums) to scoop the food while the handle is rubbery and easy for baby to hold and/or chomp on while those teeth work their way on out. We also splurged and got the matching adjustable bibs for all three kids.

"After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates. I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanism Kidco Center Gateway: --------------------- cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5"" Tall  / fits 29.25"" to 37.5"" doorway width  / 1"" bar to step over / gate opening 22"" -  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22"".  (This certainly won points from my 6'2"" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature. -  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out. - This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75"" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75"" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become ""weaker"" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37"" and your door opening is 36.5"", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34""). -  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white. -  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1"" high (seems less of a tripping risk). -  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04) -  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need. -  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up. -  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller. -  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it! Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate --------------------------------------------- cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36"" Tall / fits 28""-48"" doorway width / 2"" bar to step over / gate opening 19"" -  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal. -  The gate opening is about 19"" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider. -  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it. -  It does come with its own extensions in 5"" and 10"" so it more easily fits the wider doorways. -  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33"" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5"" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75"" as needed). -  It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks. -  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2"". -  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money. First Years - Hands-Free Gate ----------------------------- cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32"" Tall  / fits 29""-34"" doorway width / 1.5"" bar to step over / gate opening 17"" - My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17"" wide! I'm 5'8"" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However... - The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width. - Good height to the gate. - It was very sturdy in my doorway. - This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor. - Fits only up to 34"" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension. -  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one. All three gates seemed to: - Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly. - Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall. - Were pretty easy to set up. - All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look ""cheaper"" to me than the others. Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.   Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value. Good luck with your own purchase!",7/24/2005,126.0,125.0,A32FGHKCNU8P5U,B000058DK0,5.0,1.0,956150.0,69.0,Best gate I've found,0.0,1

"After reading the reviews on both, I was undecided whether to buy the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Champ. So I bought both and tried them side-by-side. I got the Genie on sale for $19, plus the an extra insert for $5. I bought the Champ for $25 after a $5 coupon. I brought them home and first set up the Genie for it's two-week test run. I loved it. Since it seals each diaper individually, you don't have to throw out a whole bag for a few days worth of diapers. And yes, you'll want to empty it out every three to four days. But that's no problem: press the cut button, give it a turn, two at the most, take the unit to the garbage and open the bottom. The sausage links fall out and you tie up the top again. Easy, clean, no need to mess with the diapers themselves. Then I set up the Champ. It almost got boxed up its first day. It did almost nothing to control the smell. So I emptied it out and exchanged it, thinking I must have bought a defective one. Nope. The next one was just as bad. I could smell the first messy diaper immediately. Essentially, it's a trash can with an allegedly smell proof lid, but it can't even accomplish that. Then when it's time to empty it out, you are back to emptying a trash can, which means opening the lid, exposing the diapers to the air, and throwing out an essentially empty garbage bag. You will change the bag every day or two. It smells bad. Very. So it's all well and fine that you can use any suitably sized trash bag in it, but you'll go through them that much faster, too. To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it. One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods. The Champ may be nice for newborns with their odorless diapers, since all you have to do is insert diaper and flip the handle, but in my opinion, by the time your kids get to solid foods and the resulting odor, stick with the Genie. Incidentally, one insert lasted me one month for a one-year-old and a three-year-old who has occasional accidents in her nap-time pull-up.",2/5/2006,4.0,2.0,A2B05PNA67H4IJ,B00003TL7P,1.0,1.0,1016404.0,246.0,Diaper Champ v.

"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc.  This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install.  So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way.  On the whole, it's worked well.  To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full.  The one problem is the mechanism it uses to ""roll"" the diaper into the chamber often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem.

"After seeing my brother's VR3 in action, I gritted my teeth, ignored the bad reviews and took the risk.  Mine has performed just as well as his does.  Pros:  the compact design is totally unobtrusive in my dash, the forward/back controls are easy to use while driving, having the option of connecting by USB or audio-in is very handy.  Cons:  I had a little difficulty finding a good station among the presets (but that could just be a peculiarity of my town), when the unit is turned off it resets to the beginning of the track instead of just pausing, shuffle works fine when it's reading from a smaller storage device but gets super slow when it's reading too many files.  I use mine mostly with a USB microSD card reader.   My microSD card is 4G, and if I fill it up, start-up and shuffle become unbearably slow.  With 1-2G on it, it works fine (who really needs 4G of music at one time anyway?).  I've been super happy with mine so far, and haven't had any of the technical difficulties that others say they've had.  Most of the cons I've mentioned are common for transmitters of this price-range, and the pros are the reasons I chose this one over the others in the price-range.  I highly recommend getting a small USB microSD card reader to use with this, the ""Sandisk MobileMate Micro"" is absolutely tiny - about half the length of the average Flashdrive so it won't stick out of the unit like a sore thumb J.  I've also gotten in the habit of skipping to the next song right before I turn the car off, so I don't hear the same song start over when I turn it on next.  That's just a small annoyance from an otherwise fantastic little device.",9/5/2008,0.0,0.0,A1QMQ2AXURPVRN,B000EO771W,4.0,0.0,528342.0,10.0,"Good product in general, GREAT for the price!",0.0,0
"After searching around the internet for a pen-mouse with pressure-sensitivity, I came upon this product and decided to give it a try despite the fact that I could find little information on it.  I returned it after two days of use. The ""ergonomic"" pen is unbelievably light and isn't weighted to improve ease of use.  The pen is made out of hollow plastic, it rests strangely in the hand, and it doesn't seem to respond consistently. In order to get any use out of the pen, I was forced to hold it at an awkward angle (almost a 90-degree angle) and, over a short period, I found that it would stop responding as I eased back into a more natural position.  What's more is that the cord, which weighs far more than the pen itself, constantly got in the way and made it even more difficult to use. What really excited me about this pen-mouse was that it had a fairly high number of levels of pressure-sensitivity (as high as my low-cost Wacom pad!).  Unfortunately, this didn't matter as precision was an absolute joke and it was nearly impossible to force the pen-mouse to do any of the things I needed (from drawing to web browsing and other simple actions). I highly recommend staying away from this mouse.  Whether you're using it for its ergonomic ""benefits"" (after holding this pen at a 90-degree angle for an hour or so my wrist was killing me) or for its potential for artistic application, this pen-mouse is a flat-out disaster.",4/3/2006,10.0,10.0,A2NBASPZH4H3T,B000ELQO8W,1.0,0.0,528657.0,8.0,Difficult and poor product,0.0,0

"After sent away to properly learn how to marry, Victor, while practicing jokingly puts a finger on a branch. But, when a corpse of a murdered bride pops out and claims that she is Victor's rightful bride, He has a dilimma that sends him to find out if there really is true love in death til we part. Tim Burton has been notoriously known to have a weird style of film aking. Look at his films, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, Big Fish. They have all have strange characters. This film is no exception. Burton sets out that he still has his style and weirdness. He is probably the only one of the filmmakers that can show beauty in things grotesque. He takes the weirdest things, the weirdest people, and somehow makes them human. He shows that the grossest things have a heart, and that you can care for them. He is a great storyteller. He can take stories and make them into fairy tales, myths of legend, or just plain legend. He strokes the imaginations of all his viewers by providing us with great visuals and vibrant colors. Tim Burton can make some very beautiful films. This can be added to that list. Danny Elfman has created some great songs and scores for Burton. This was probably one of his most solid efforts as a composer. His score perfectly fit the scenes and his songs were great. He can take the music and make the scene even more beautiful with his score. His score can make or break the film, but it didn't have to because of some of the score was fantastic. The voice work was solid. I thought that Johnny Depp was perfect for the part of Victor, because he has that style and the voice that would suit the character. Also, Helena Boham Carter also did some great voice work, and I am glad to see that she is getting mainstream work, after all of her long years on the independent circuit. Also, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee were great as their respective characters. The only problem that I had was with the short runtime. I felt that they could've made it longer and devolop it more, but it is stop-motion animation, after all. Even if they made it longer, it would take more time and money to do that and it would end up making the film come out later than this year. I was glad that they got a beautiful film done in the short amount of time that they did it in. I was please that they accomplished a whole lot. Overall, This was a beautifully, vivid movie made by the king of quirkyness, Tim Burton. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was a great animaton, and it deserves some regonition and respect from people that love and cherish Burton's films. I feel that Tim Burton is a great master of the art of making quirky things beautiful. Some people say that Sam Mendes is the king, but in my humble opinon, I feel that Tim Burton is the king of all things quirky. I urge you to see this marvolously beautiful film.",9/25/2005,3.0,1.0,A36HBE2C5SQ2E6,B000C3L27U,4.0,0.0,535095.0,69.0,This movie is alive and well.,0.0,0
"After seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas about five-hundred times (that may not be an exaggeration), and loving it every time I saw it, I couldn't wait to get something new from the same creator as Nightmare. Corpse Bride was that something new, and though Nightmare is definitely the better of the two, Corpse Bride is still fun and entertaining nonetheless. It revolves around the arranged marriage of two young people, names of Victor and Victoria, both of whom have no idea what they are getting into until the very last moments before the marriage. But surprisingly, at the rehearsal, they have a connection, and their marriage seems as though it won't be such a bad thing. Still, though, Victor is nervous to the point of bumbling, and fails his marriage vows miserably. Told to practice his lines, the rehearsal is postponed and Victor makes a quick escape into the woods. While here, he practices on the nearby trees, only not everything is a tree. In accident, he places his ring on the hand of a dead woman named Emily, who becomes Victor's corpse bride. From here, Victor must find a way to escape from the land of the dead and get back to his fiancee Victoria, while we, the viewers, are trying to figure out how the corpse bride got to where she is now. Though short, Corpse Bride still has a lot to offer. The animation is great, far more detailed than Nightmare, and the moody settings are what you expect from Tim Burton. And the character designs are excellent; every one is unique from the rest and all of them have personality. To add to that, the voice acting was exceptional as well, with songs that sound similar to that of The Nightmare Before Christmas. And where the length of the film may not be so much, the DVD extras surely make up for it. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, or who grew up watching the claymation Christmas cartoons. Also, as an artistic film, there are few to rival Corpse Bride. It sets a dreary mood at the beginning, and continually adds to that mood throughout, yet is still able to draw laughs.",2/4/2006,5.0,4.0,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000C3L27U,4.0,1.0,535290.0,264.0,Entertaining Nonetheless,0.0,0

"After some extensive research, I settled on the D50 as the best value in the dSLR market.  I worked it down to the D50, the D70s, and the Canon Digital Rebel. It was my goal to jump from taking a bunch of point-and-shoot photos with my much-beloved Fuji camera to really learning photography with some level of sophistication by jumping to a DSLR with some real power. I am still working my way along the learning curve as a photographer, but I have been thrilled with the d50.  I had the benefit of a friend with a d70 and was able to handle that camera extensively before my purchase.  It has some added features, but if you, like me, are not at a photography level where you need cutting-edge stuff like depth-of-field preview, you would never know the difference.  I have yet to take a photograph and have the feeling that I wish I had spent the extra money on the d70.  It may well be that this is an ""entry-level"" dSLR, but if that is a fair description, it is also fair to say that the ""entry"" point is very high.  More often than not, the phrases ""value"" or ""entry-level"" imply ""get ready to be disappointed.""  That is definitely NOT the case here.  If you've never had a pro-level dSLR, at least, you'll feel like you're using a Ferrari. One concession I did make to the d70 was the lens, however.  The consensus on the lens is that the d70 comes with a better base lens than the d50, so I bought the d50 body and the d70 kit lens separately.  I've been very happy with the results.",3/28/2006,8.0,8.0,AKN6V8YF1ORLO,B000BWE4TK,5.0,0.0,536373.0,115.0,Great place to start in digital photography,0.0,0

"After several months of exhaustive research, and seemingly endless trips to BB and CC to compare models directly, I finally ended up purchasing this set. Amazingly, I have no regrets whatsoever.  That's right, zero buyer's remorse!  For the money (see the Target pricing in other reviews), you simply cannot do better than this set.  SD satellite is surprisingly good--even compared to my previous CRT.  After calibration DVDs are stunning.  HDTV finally gives me that 'looking out a window' feeling. Minor quibbles:  The remote is indeed very cheap.  I use an all-in-one learning remote anyway, so that's not an issue.  Some people don't like the glass in front of the screen; it does have an anti-glare coating, but it will give you some reflections depending on your viewing area (as will CRTs, and plasma).  Some people have reported problems with the image turning green occasionally when using the HDMI input.  Tech support will send you a new input box (easily swapped out with a couple of screws) that corrects the problem.  A few people have reported their sharpness setting not ""sticking"" on the component inputs.  I haven't had either of these issues. If you have a surround sound system, you can remove the factory speakers (below the screen in the image above), and lower it on its stand, so that it looks much more sleek, and plasma-like.

"After skimming through the other reviews I have to aggree with most of them.  The notebook was fast and more than adequate for school.  It played DVDs well and accepts aftermarket software to its nice memory space without slowing down performance. On the downside... It DID get very hot from use and the battery life was very very short.  Even after reconditioning the battery a few times it only gained a marginal increase in battery life.  It doesn't handle gaming very well.  The frame rate was ridiculously slow if a lot is going on in the game and the loading times were exceptionally long.  But, nobody ever said this was a gaming computer and it isn't the reason I bought the thing. For my conversion from desktop to notebook, I was happy with the decision.  I only wish I hadn't bought it so soon after it entered the market as I paid top dollar not knowing that the depreciation over one single year was 50% of the original cost. Don't get me started on the customer service.  Absolutely worthless and time-consuming to tackle.  All I can say is don't hold your breath for them to ""give you a call sometime"" to resolve any issues or get some information to you.

"After selling two computers, yes two, to my parents i decided to get something that was gonna last for many years, and something that i could do anything on that i could do on a desktop. Also something that was portable was what i wanted most. After searching and searching and countless computers, i realized i was gonna have to pay the BIG bucks to achieve what i wanted. I had saw the Qosmio but had always hated how ""finger printed"" up the interior looked when i saw them in stores, from people using them. Its a pet peave that i don't like prints or smudges for that matter. So after a lot of thought i went for the F25 from a website called Clearance Club for 1349 plus tax, i didnt think it was a bad deal till i saw the F25 on the Toshiba Direct site for 1099$, so i thought i just got ripped. After careful consideration i looked at the G25 which was only a few hundred dollars more, 1349!! to be exact, they didnt have any in stock until a few days later so i said what the hell and went for it, even though i wasnt to fond of the gargantuen 17"" screen. Well having gotten the G25 when i still had the F25 i decided why not test them side by side, being that it was a weekend and couldnt ship the other back yet. Here's the Pro's and Con's i found. F25-Sharp Clean Picture G25-A Bit Brighter, although maybe to bright? F25-Great Harman Kardon speakers, very loud and bassy G25-Same speakers although not as loud,(i must point out both of these were refurbished for one reason or another, so the speakers or sound card may have been the issue here) F25-Basic 100gig hard drive, seems like a lot until you record live TV. G25-Serial ATA 120 gig, double hard drives, 20 gigs makes a difference. F25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-64mb-Doom 3 1024x768 low quality. G25-Nvidia Geforce 6600 Go Graphics Card-128mb-Doom 3 1024x800 High Quality-Its noticeble side by side. No hesitation. Also 1440x900 Max screen resolution. F25-WiFi b/g Wireless G25-Same F25-15.4 inch wide screen,Very Light, Good for toating around. G25-17.4 inch wide screen, Very Heavy, Not good for toating around. Although better for movies at home. F25-Darker Black Interior-Smudges aren't AS noticeble, but still bad. G25-The thing i hate most,terrible at fingerprints and smudges, has a slightly glossier black face. F25-Good DVD-R-RW multi burner, basic pop-out from the side. G25-Very cool DVD-R-RW multi Burner, inserts from the front, slide in compartment. Burns a little quicker than the F25 i think. Loads loud though, minor issue. F25-1.86 pentium 750M processor, centrino. G25-2.01 Pentium 760M Processor, Centrino. F25-1024 gig of RAM G25-1 gig F25-Refurbished-Cheapist anywhere, Toshiba Direct-1099$, New on other sites, anywhere from 1600, to 2000$. G25-Refurbished-Cheapest anywhere, Toshiba Direct-1349, New on other sites anywhere from, 1549$ to 3000$. So with all these side by side the differences are very minor between the F25 and the G25, there were certain things i liked better abuot each but when it came to mas-multi tasking and just over all ability i had to go for the G25 even though its not perfect its the best your gonna get for a laptop, multimedia center. All others definately fall short when it comes to the specs this thing has. Basic laptops even HP's higher series most come with an ATI Radeon 200M which u can't even put on medium resolution 800x600 for Doom 3 or Farcry. Even some of the higher end Hp's come with a Nvidia Geforce 7300 go, which is a low end 7 series, not even as good as the 6600.

"After searching every review I could find online about DVRs I finaly settled on this model from Panasonic. It had all the features I wanted and Amazon's price was fantastic.$110 less than Circut City localy and their price on the web to. No sales tax either. I did spring for the 2 day shipping even though it came with free super saver shipping. I wanted it before Thanksgiving, they shipped it on Monday and I recieved it on Wednessday afternoon. I played with it a while Wednessday evening and set it to record manualy then left for the holiday, came home and all the movies I would have otherwise missed were waiting for me. The TV guide works perfectly with no cable box, just standard cable from Adelphia. Alhtough it didnt download correctly unil Sunday night, it is working great now. I had set it to record 12 movies and 6 hours of regular shows while I was gone for the holiday, all on standard play. I had 48 minutes of record time left after all of that, and several of the movies were 3 hours long and the rest were 2 hours. Now that is a LOT of recording!

"After seeing and reading mostly 4- and 5-star reviews for the Kensington transmitter, I decided to ake a chance on it. This Digital FM Transmitter/Charger for the iPod works great. It is extremely easy to use. I simply plugged it in, tuned my radio to a free station, matched the Kensington, and pressed play on my iPod. While the sound quality is probably not quite as good as a CD, it's not bad at all. It's no worse than a very strong radio station. I should also note that I haven't had time to play with some of the settings as described by the top spotlight reviewer, so I can probably still improve the sound quality.

"After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection. Many of the complaints seem to arise from assumptions made about the player and capabilities it was not intended to feature, rather than product which doesn't live up to its claims. I've just bought a new SOMY Walkman A3000 20 GB because I want more storage, but I will keep this little beauty because it's the only one I know that runs on a battery.

"After seeing some examples of photos from this gem of camera paired with a substantial [...] and getting a good price on selling my D100, did I finally make the plunge to a professional level digital camera. I am a serious amateur and I have owned this camera for about three months and shot off nearly 2000 photos under a variety of conditions. The camera is used with an ED glass zoom Nikkor lens G 28-200 mm and a Nikon SB600 flash. And I could not be happier with my new toy, um . . . tool. The image quality is superb with its 12 MP CMOS sensor. The build of the camera is a very durable magnesium body with well placed and well made controls. You can change ISO, image size, autofocus settings, shift from autofocus to manual and a number of other setting right from the camera body. Potentially if I became familiar enough with these controls I could make the changes without ever taking my eye from the camera. Furthermore, the camera is environmentally sealed and meant to be used under a variety of demanding conditions though I do not recommend taking it or any other electronic device into the rain without adequate protection. The grip both horizontal and vertical felt secure in my hands. There is a vertical shutter button with dials on the body to alter shutter and aperture settings. There are locks to prevent inadvertant firing of the vertical shutter button and shifting of the auto sensor for focus and metering. Below the depth of field preview button there is an additional button to which you can aside a variety of functions. I have it set to spot metering. The camera body unlike other Nikons does not come with a pop up flash though it does have a hotshoe. There is an additional sensor for white balance over the pentaprism. For those taking sports the camera has a high speed crop mode which shoots off much faster pictures but at a reduced resolution of 8 MP. There are three selections of metering: spot, center and the new 3D Color Matrix Metering II all of which may be changed from the right side of the pentaprism. I've found the Matrix Metering to be strikingly accurate with just a few times where the metering is fooled but this has been primarily where there have been extremes in lighting such as a night scene with a bright street light in the view. The auto white balance though not perfect has certainly been an improvement over that of the D100. You can also select your own white balance either from a grey card, a white card or even from ambient light. I have primarily use the autowhite balance. When I've had to use autofocus mainly for my cute rocket powered niece, it has been quite fast and accurate. The camera uses an electric cable release. You need to remove a small screw top from the front portion of the camera on side opposite of the shutter. At the time of this review the Nikon brand release MC-30 are not in stock anywhere though I've seen the fancier MC-36 available several places. A third party release such as one from Adorama is less expensive and seems to do the job. The camera performs very well at most of its ISO settings. The lowest is 100 and the highest which is the equivalent of 3200 called ""HI-2."" The noise up to HI-1 (1600) is actually not bad since it is more like film grain than true digital noise which is neither entirely random nor nearly as pleasing. For those adverse to noise, the camera has an excellent noise reduction system which eliminates nearly all noise up to about 400 to 800 ISO. I have not noted any banding my JPEG images. There are actually a ton of other features which I am not going to detail here. There are a few downsides to this camera. It is quite heavy and large. I'd recommend that you go to your local camera store and hold the camera. Those with neck and back problems may find it too heavy and those with small to medium small sized hands may find it difficult to operate. Also due to its size you are going to attract attention so you'll need to be more vigilent. Because of the high resolution of the camera you need to have excellent technique mainly in holding the camera. The Matrix Metering is so usually right on that you will notice more of your photos will be far better exposed. Though ""correct"" exposure is a matter of artistic intent. You also need excellent glass on the camera. If know you will be using the cable release I would remove the small screw top from the camera body and leave it at home. It is screaming to get lost. Lastly, this camera is expensive and is not for the casual photographer as you will be paying for many features which you will never use. For a comprehensive listing for features I refer you to Thom Hogan, dpreview or Nikonians. For those ready to step up to a pro level camera then the versatile D2X will make be an excellent fit for all many types of photography.",5/29/2006,28.0,28.0,ACXPRSPIVAS6H,B0007X7W6K,5.0,0.0,570705.0,9.0,A very fine tool,0.0,0

"After some 400 photos, I have mixed feelings about the camera.  I've been using non-DSLRs for four years, and have owned 5 of these.  All of the others allow more consistent results than the XT.  However, I am relearning my old SLR ways (the hard way). I LOVE the viewfinder and the speed!  The housing looks good, but scratches easily.  As with all DSLRs, it is exceptionally easy to get dust on the CMOS sensor (and difficult to clean).  Sure wish they'd fix this (couldn't they put a charge on the sensor to repel rather than attract dust?)!  AWB mode yields varying results (looking at a series of daylight photos taken in different directions seconds apart, it's amazing that some are overexposed, some underexposed, and some have obviously better white balance than others).  Wish the ISO extended to 3200.  Until a smaller, better build camera comes out, this will be the one!",3/30/2005,25.0,18.0,A3TCMJ6GKZJFBQ,B0007QKMSC,4.0,1.0,574526.0,326.0,Great Camera!,0.0,0

"After seeing this display in person, I had to run out and buy one. In Windows at 2650x1600 it seems to display things about the same size as my 20"" monitor does at 1600x1200, but you get more than twice as much on the screen as the 20"" (2.1333 times to be more exact). Besides hearing about how stunningly beautiful it is, here are some things you might like to know about it: It will hook directly to a MacBook Pro's DVI port without any adapters or mods, and display at full resolution. If you're using it on a PC, you need dual-link DVI capability (not the same as dual DVI). I thought this would mean paying a lot of money for a new video card, but it doesn't. I called ATI and ordered a Radeon x1650 Pro PCIe card direct, which cost $150. It displays at the full 2650x1600 resolution with no problems, has 512MB DDR2 memory, video out, and though it includes several cables and adapters, none are required to hook the display up. In fact it seems faster than my two year old $700 card did. I do mostly digital photography (Photoshop), and it is plenty fast. I don't think that unless you're doing 3D modeling or serious gaming, that you'll need anything more. It is also Vista ready, so it can handle all the features of Vista (translucent windows or whatever. I don't have Vista). There are 3 plugs on the cable. One is the DVI plug, the second is a Firewire (400 not 800), and the third is USB. The latter two are to provide you with 2 USB and 2 Firewire ports at the back of the display. Now for the drawbacks, or should I say drawback. The only positioning adjustment is the ability to tilt the display. Although it is easy to rotate the image 90 degrees, it would require rigging something up to rotate the monitor. There is no height adjustment so I can't squeeze the center speaker of my audio underneath the display (I'd call it a monitor, but since it's Apple, they refer to them as displays). Included software assist you in setting the levels and color to the right settings. When I bought it, I considered it an extravagance, but after using it for a few weeks, I've changed my mind. It increases productivity immeasurably being able to keep multiple windows open, not having to zoom in and out while editing photographs, and being able to display 39 columns (64 pixel) and 66 rows (20 pixel) of an Excel spreadsheet.Or 3 legal size pages at 100% side by side in Word without scrolling. Pretty cool, huh? It's also extremely stylish, and along with my DiNovo Edge keyboard, it could go in a museum. When I bought it from Amazon, it was $1,924 plus a 5% discount at the time, no tax, and $10 shipping. It came out to be about $125 less than what I would have paid from Apple with their education program discount (since they charge 6% tax and I'm also getting 3% in rewards bonuses using my Amazon credit card). But even at full retail it would have been worth it. I am in love with this display! Any of you gamers interested in an ATI Radeon x850XT Platinum graphics card? Oh yeah, the new card takes up only one slot instead of two, so there's another bonus... Originally I was going to use this display with my MacBook Pro for my digital photo work, but now that it's connected to the PC, I literally can't take my eyes off of it. Does anybody know of a cable or switch that would allow me to use it for both and switch between them conveniently? If you buy one piece of expensive computer hardware this year, this display should be it. You won't regret it.

"After seeing the reviews in every magazine saying the new Microsoft Money 2005 beat the new Quicken hands down, I thought maybe I should upgrade from 2003 to 2005 premium.

I have Fleet and Citibank accounts, neither of which would auto-sync with 2003, so I was relegated to downloaded statements each month and importing them. I was also expecting to be able to sync with my online brokerage accounts at Charles Schwab and Ameritrade.

"After spending $180, I'm terribly disappointed.  When I first tried these the fit was so fickle and shifty I got disgusted and put them in a drawer.

To make matters worse, the cord is so heavy and long that it literally yanks the earbuds out of your ear....ugh!!!!!!!!!!!

I expected either Sony or Toshiba to deliver the most superior and vibrant picture, but I was wrong.  Next to them was this JVC that far exceeded what I had expected for the price.  It's picture looks nearly as life-like as a screen with HDTV, and it is filled with many options that are usually only available on larger models.  It has many RCA cabel hook-ups, (S-Video, component, and color stream) which are all easily accessable.  It's front hook-up is conveniently concealed behind a cover panel, and all other menu options are also easily accessed behind this panel.  It's speakers sound great, and about the supposedly ""unbearable humming noise"" that exists on all JVC's and Toshiba's- I still haven't heard it on my set.

"After seeing the ads for the Digital Frame, My mother ordered it for my birthday.  It arrived today *August 1)in time, but right now - we are disappointed.  Unlike the clear, full color pics shown in the ads, the pictures on the Digital Frame are washed out, pale, grainy, and if YOU do not view from direct center, even turn ""negative"".  I am a  photographer - have done work for newspapers and magazines - and  the Digital Frame makes good photos look bad, and bad ones - well.....  Either the display is bad, or the product - but when viewd, a black or a dark color turns negative and when viewed from the side, it is a negative.    COlors are pale - not crisp and clean like on a current laptop, of flat panel monitor.  When viewed in daylight, you can hardly see the pictures. And at night - not much better.  I was hoping that i would get the clarity of a laptop, at the least, but laptops four years ago were clearer.  I will definately tell everyone that this product, as far as I am concerned, is misrepresented in its avertising. The quality is poor.

"After seeing the bad reviews, I almost didn't purchase PDF Producer. However, I called Data Becker (during normal business hours at 617-614-0600) and, with very little trouble, got a live person on the phone who answered all of my questions and allayed my concerns.  Two good hints: It only works with Win 2000 or XP (as it says right on the specs); and, it's important to close ALL programs (including printer software) running in the backgroun before loading. PDF Producer loaded flawlessly in a few minutes on my Windows XP system with MS Office 2003. It works just like any other printer driver, and I personally like the idea that it doesn't intimately integrate with other programs (such as putting an icon on the task bars) -- if something does go wrong with PDF Producer my other programs are still in business. The product works excellently -- making PDF files of anything that can normally be printed. The PDF Producer settings needed a bit of tweaking to get the quality and file size I wanted, and this was easily done following the built-in help screens or the manual that came with the retail package. PDF Producer doesn't have all the functionality of Adobe Acrobat, but at about 1/6 the price it is a very cost-effective solution for turning just about anything into a basic PDF.",11/2/2003,13.0,13.0,A2NAAEOWL0G6VC,B00009L7N6,4.0,1.0,660656.0,18.0,PDF Producer is an excellent product.,0.0,0
"After searching for nearly a year for a security camera system for our home that we could view while travelling, I was thrilled to find out about Wilife. I read all the information on the Wilife website, and also what was available here on Amazon before purchasing.  Because our needs were specific, I made sure that they would be filled with this kit.  Here's what we needed: 1.  Remote camera that did not require hardwiring to connect to computer (computer is upstairs, camera position is downstairs). 2.  Camera triggered by motion, rather than always recording. 3.  Online access to the recorded video. After reading about the system, I realized I'd need to not only pay for the camera kit, but to get online access to recorded video (streaming video access is free) I'd also need to sign up for WiLife Platinum, at an additional $80 a year.  A steep price, but worth it if we'd be able to see any activity in the house by reviewing the recorded video online every evening. The system was very easy to set up, and worked acceptably well (the software did have a glitch when changing settings which I never did work out).  After signing up for platinum I was able to access recorded video online with my laptop computer, but my mobile device (HP iPaq 5915) would only access live video. I tried different operating systems (upgrading my Explorer Mobile, and switching to Opera Mobile), but still was only able to get live video to work. After re-reading the information on the WiLife site which stated: ""Go beyond live Internet viewing. Access your recorded video at anytime, anywhere.  Use easy search tools to locate and view video by date, time, and site - with up to the minute availability."" The site even showed a photo of a person accessing recorded video with a Blackberry, I assumed this must be an issue with my hardware, my software, or just 'operator error', so I continued to work through the problem. After a week of trying every possible solution, I contacted WiLife support, and after a few useless emails which did not address the problem, finally received one stating: ""Cellphones/handheld devices can not do remote playback. They can only do remote viewing in relay mode."" So, it is being packed up and shipped back to Amazon. I'm left wondering why Logitec would use a proprietary viewer for the recorded video, when the streaming video uses the regular Windows viewer available on all systems? And the biggest why - why would they advertise that remote playback was available 'anywhere anytime' when in fact it is NOT? In my opinion, this system is not worth anything to the average user until we can access recorded video via mobile device.  Once Logitec actually offering what they're advertising (anywhere, anytime), I'll happily purchase the product again.",6/30/2008,3.0,2.0,A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS,B000E0I9K4,1.0,1.0,666099.0,23.0,"Hardware is great, software severely lacking.",0.0,0

But, I wanted to do one better than my friend and get the Mvix MV-5000U (I think this model is the latest and supposedly most advanced of its kind) with the FM transmitter thinking I can use it in the car without the cassette adapter.  WRONG. Maybe I don't know how to use this unit properly because the sound quality is bad.  I hear hissing noise through the FM.  Same song plays well if I connect it directly to my sound system. The remote control is not very responsive.  I have to press the same button several times before it does anything. On the positive note, it plays most of my DivX, XviD files and all of my MP3 files.  Watching the video on the TV is a great experience.  Installing and configuring the hard drive was a snap.  I haven't tried the DVD ISO but hope it will play just as well. On the negative note, yes it is portable but its bigger than the Modix (about 50% thicker).  I feel the screen on the unit is useless.  After a week, the fan on the unit started to make noticeable sound. Because I had a chance to compare my Mvix with my friends Modix, I feel that I made a bad choice.  Mvix looked very slick on the internet but not in real life.  The company's support was sub par in my experience (their web support is non existent).  I am not a technically savvy person.

"After searching through reviews online, I decided to purchase the HB-207.  Users had lauded its comfort, ease of use, and versatility.  The bag is very sturdy, comfortably designed, and has the capability of holding a ton of equipment.  In fact, there are times when I have loaded down the bag to the point that it didn't meet airline carry-on weight expectations.  Nevertheless, because it is a backpack, I've never been asked to weigh it or check it at the airline counter. The bag is a bit large for casual use.  I would not recommended it as a day pack due to its bulky girth.  The bag is also not as convenient as a traditional shoulder bag when it comes to accessing your gear.  Despite its size, however, it still comfortably fits in an airline luggage compartment. The rear laptop compartment fits a bit snug.  If you are using a Mac or a small, slim computer, you should be fine. But if your computer measures greater than 15 1/2"" x 11"" x 2"", you'll be shoving and prodding just to get it to fit. In conclusion, the bag's pros consist of sturdy, well-crafted design, comfort, space, versatility, and, to a degree, inconspicuousness.  The cons might be it's lack of easy access on the field and its girth, rendering it useless for day trips.

It seems that it will always get you where you're going, usually by the shortest route, but not always.

We recently moved to a new city and it has been invaluable for house hunting, etc. We doubt that there is a better unit available for anything close to the current price (about $400).

"After six weeks of use, I enjoy falling asleep to the iPod. Very convenient for that. I appreciate being able to fall asleep to the iPod and being able to wake to a preset radio station or alarm. Many devices will awaken you to whatever sound source put you to sleep. However...the alarm time is tricky to change. Lots of ""keystrokes"" and knob-twisting. Also--and this is a big problem in our house--you cannot seem to set the radio volume for the alarm. It increases in volume to become VERY loud, and will force you to turn it down if you want to listen for a while. You can set the sleep volume, and the radio volume (for normal listening), but cannot control the alarm volume. If it is next to your head, it will be very intrusive when you awaken, and is sure to bother your partner who awakens at a different time (but from a different clock, since this has but one alarm setting). If the ihome is not next to your head, you cannot turn it down because you can't reach it (oops--did you not buy the remote control at extra cost?).

"After some reasearch on the different camcorders available on the market, I had no doubt that the Canon Optura 60 was the superior choice.  After receiving the unit I had no problem getting set up and was snapping pictures and making videos in no time. One feature that sets this camcorder apart from others is it's ability to take high quality 2 mega-pixel still shots, recording them to a Secure-Digital card.  From my previous experience with Canon cameras it seems that they really know what they are doing in terms of digital photography and the Optura 60 continues to amaze.  The camera has produced still shots that are equal or better in quality to my Olympus C-740UZ. The video quality is excellent and it is very easy to copy your still shots and videos using USB 2.0 OR Firewire to your Windows XP PC. Despite a complicated array of features, the camera can be very simple to use for those who just want to set everything to ""AUTO"", then point and shoot.

"After some research, I purchased this product and it works really well. I used it on a trip from DC to NY and it got me right to the front door of where I needed to be. It's simple interface is very easy to use, there are no downloads required. I didn't open the manual at all - it's that easy. You can save your locations into a favorites menu.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles like traffic navigation or cell phone connectivity of the higher priced options, but as a basic GPS it's great. If I had one complaint it's that sometimes it chooses some wonky ways to get to various places.  For instance I had to go to an address that turned out to be less than a mile away. Instead of taking me on the main highway and doing a simple turn, it took me through the back roads of the division next to my house. Now it could have done this because the location was on a one way street, so coming in off the main highway was sort of impossible.  But it still got me to the front door.

"After setting up this router, it would not connect to the internet.  I, then decided to disconnect the router and try to connect directly through the modem, but I could not connect on the computer with which I had tried to set up the router, but I could with my other computer.

I then contacted Dell who manufactured my computer.  The tech at Dell could not resolve the problem, so he conferenced with me with my internet provider.

"After searching for a case of this type for my U2 ipod, I settled on this one because it's the only one of its type I found available.  First, I'm disappointed that there are so few available for us ghetto-ipod owners. =)  The only clear cases I could find were for the nano, shuffle, and video.  This is the only one for my 4th gen U2 special edition so my choices were limited. That being said, this case does its job.  It's crystal clear so you can see the beautiful black and red of my ipod, as well as the signatures on the back.  The sleeve it came with didn't fit on my ipod.  I couldn't get it on so I just put my ipod carefully into the case.  It fits very well and my ipod isn't rattling around in the case.  The bottom locks tightly so I'm not worried about my ipod falling out which is good.  I'm not planning on removing the ipod from the case because I'm afraid of it getting scratched, but I want to try to fit the protective sleeve on when it's not so hot and humid outside.  It has been said that there's a problem with dock connectors which I can see, since the opening only allows enough room for the USB cable or firewire to connect to the ipod. Long story short: For purposes of protecting the ipod, it seems stellar.  I wouldn't recommend sliding the ipod in and out without the protective sleeve, which at the moment doesn't fit on my ipod. I'm happy that it will protect my ipod from scratches, and at the moment I'm not worried about dock connectors.  I'm happy with it, but I would have preferred something slightly different if it was available.",8/8/2006,1.0,1.0,A1CY8YEW52BFKD,B0006BKG98,4.0,0.0,723483.0,30.0,"With a lack of options, this does the job...",0.0,0
"After seeing a wide range in the prices for HDMI cables, I did some research into why is it.

"After some patience in setting up, we are delighted with finally receiving DTV!!  One serious thing that should be noted: if you have an analog set, as we do, MAKE SURE you set the rear little switch to analog or you'll get a white screen.  This is not in the instructions and we had the unit replaced thinking it was defective. We live about 25 to 40 miles to the transmitters past some hills and are connecting our Sony WEGA analog set to the unit.  Unless you live relatively close and have a flatland situation, you really should get a quality UHF antenna (Radio Shack has an excellent one), a rotor system, and a preamp. that mounts next to the antenna to boost the signal (Channel Master 7777 Titan2 VHF/UHF model).  Although the receiver is strong, a good clean signal is really important to reduce/eliminate dropouts. Goods: quality picture, offers signal strength meter to help point up your antenna, simple and well-laid-out controller, strong RF amplifier for boosting signals, good price. Quirks: Took us a long time (over days) to figure out the best way to add channels: use autolearn once for the bulk and then rotate your antenna to the other channels and add them manually.  The controller's IR beam is aimed a little UP, so if you aim it at your TV, it actually hits the receiver.  The zoom feature is great for channels that use HDTV and then have a smaller display for normal 3x4 programs - but as it zooms to fill your screen, it distorts the width so the pix is out of proportion; bad planning.   Next, you cannot use the controller to directly access the ""-"" channels (e.g. 3-1, 12-3, etc.).  The picture tends to ""pixelate"" when there is fast motion, scene changes, anything that creates a demand for repainting the screen info.  I don't know if this is the compressor power inside the receiver or that's the way it's being transmitted. Summary: We are simply ecstatic with the receiver.  We watched a PBS special ""Celtic Women"" with crystal clear presentation and digital sound.  We live with the fuzzy pix when it has to keep up with motion - it's not that bad.  The antenna is the key: it MUST be exactly aligned with the station transmitter (see Antennaweb.org - they have point-up directions) or things go to pot.  I would classify the device as: Highly Recommended.",3/4/2006,19.0,19.0,A15375ZVDULRRP,B00064L1AI,4.0,1.0,732502.0,41.0,Quality Receiver at a Reasonable Price,0.0,0

"After seeing BOSE's Noise Cancelling headset, and reading the tech specs, I was a bit Leary of the quality of these , but they are more than worth it. If you are familiar with the concept of White Noise, then you should understand what this headset does; the difference is that this headset detects sound values, and conteracts  with varying degrees of the white noise. Whilst a white noise machine in the background is often set at a constant value, these headsets have microphones on the outer part of the left and right head-sets to detect external noise values , as well as a circuit operating the internal noise reduction.The  noise reduction will  vary according to the external sound value, and works very well, not great, but extremely  good for the price. This noise cancelling  device will go for 30 hours on standard high value triple a batteries ( one for the headset) but will work longer with Lithium E2 Batteries. If this helps: these headphones are Noise cancelling, and so whilst they do a great job of reducing standard noise, if the range is above 85-95 db, you will have a diminishing return. Since these headphones can work with no music input at all, if you use stereo ear-buds that go down the ear canal a way ( I have a set of these, but I can't remember the model and make... I checked, they are KOSS, a model called THE PLUG, and buy a small packet with different  adapters, believe me, you will need it, but do not buy the adaptors from RADIO SHACK, you will regret it, unless  you have no other choice, try COMPUSA if you are in the US, or JB-HIFI if you are in East Coast Australia) and place the Noise Cancelling  headphones over the buds, then you will have a better blocker, however, the earbuds that extend down the ear canal should be used carefully, since too high a volume is harmful, but the better response in bass, and full range sounds, are good. Its best to check the NC6 specs for the actual full coverage. If you need something more heavy duty, then go for BOSE, but these are good for the price they have. You will still hear outside sounds of higher db values, but the noise reduction cancels within a certain range. If you have a crowd around you, with constant chatter, you may need something better. However, these items so far have been superb, simply because the actives work well within a certain range ... check the specs, and check the environment you will be using these headphones in, and if you can, check the db value. Also, thanks to Amazon for making good on USPS's mess up: USPS  claimed to deliver to me  on May 29th ( A Holiday), at 2:40 am... an outright lie. I have had so many problems with USPS  deliveries  from Amazon to me, that if you can, always go for UPS.

"After seeing my 20GB iPod Apple iPod get scratched up, I knew I had to get a case. I went to the nearby electronics store to pick up a case. I saw the DLO Jacket and an iPod hard showcase. In the end, I decided to purchase the DLO Jacket. PROS: *The jacket provides a nice, sturdy for the iPod, leaving it no room for moving, therefore giving a snug fit so you feel it in your hand. *The snug feel gives it more protection in case of a drop. *There is an LCD screen protector built in, so this is excellent. *It looks nice: when you see the iPod in this sleek case for the first time, you'll love it! *Easy accesibility to the click wheel for easy navigation. *Made of durable Neoprane material. CONS: *Hard access to the docking port/Cable Connection port. *Case adds at least 7 ounes to the iPod, making it feel very heavy. *Case adds much thickness; leaving it thicker than the iPod photo. *Case heats up the iPod during long-term charging, Apple recommend you take out the iPod out of the case during charging. *Hard to remove and put in case, I always keep thinking all the shoving will damage the iPod.

"After searching for the perfect seat, we realized this is the most perfect one there is for now.  Britax is safety-conscious, has great customer service, and this seat is NICE.  I got it on sale for 200 somewhere else online, because the fabric was being discontinued (a savings of $88.00!).  The firefighter who helped me install it was impressed with the side head protectors built in.  We were able to adjust the seat in all areas easily. Making sure to put the seatbelt through the side hole, under the seat padding, behind and around the crotch latch, then out the other hole was something I didn't get from the picture, though.  Knowing this seat can hold my child up to 65 lbs. is great because I have a larger child. I should've gotten this one from birth and saved the money on the infant snugli carrier.  It was rear-facing even as my child was 23 pounds and only 9 months old.  It fits tight and perfect in the passenger sideboard position, but if I were more persistent and industrious, I might be able to figure out how to get it to fit in the middle position (I have a 2000 Blazer and the firefighter and I couldn't get it to fit tightly because the two seatbelt latches are not far enough apart in the middle, so the seat sits on top of them-not safe).  My car does not have latch, but the latch connectors would be useful if for a different car.  The side head protectors are NOT a problem, and since my son is young enough, he won't know what piece of view is missing because he'll be used to the seat and won't remember any differently.  I feel this seat is the safest and am completely confident in it.  (Now if I could just keep my lead foot in check, we'll be even safer)AN UPDATE: My son is now 15 months old, 28 lbs. extremely tall, and the side head guard grows easily with him--its sooo easy to turn the nob every few weeks. He sleeps easily with head rested against the sides and shows no signs of feeling 'restrained'.

"After seeing the picture postcard like LCD displays in many stores, I fianlly gave in to the temptation of buying a HD LCD tv - and what a tv it is! I am glad I listened to my friend who has had this set for a year and a half. Was surprised to see the rating that this tv has on amazon. Looking closer, I found that some of the negative rating were for other Panasonic tv's and not this one. A goof up somewhere. Singling out any one feature may do injustice to the many this one has to offer. Let me explain each on its own merit: 1. Picture: First thing that would bowl anyone out is the picture quality - crisp picture, great rich colors, excellent contrast, just too pleasing to the eyes. To compare the video from different sources: a. HD Cable channels: This tv enhanced the clarity of the HD channels even further, when comparing to some of the pictures I have seen in TV stores. b. Standard TV channels: The TV has a ""normal"" video mode for watching standard width format SDTV programs. Standard TV channels look very preety good on this TV, easily comparable to my old Sony Trinitron. Room Lighting effect: The TV has 3 main preset modes for different lighting conditions. Vivid is great in a well lit room. The  Normal mode is good in ""drawing room"" dimly lit conditions. The cinema mode brings home the theatre in low light conditions. Plus, the TV has good manual setting controls to change the picture ""look"" as per user tastes. 2. Sound: After setting this TV up, I did not feel the need for connecting my Onkyo speakers for a month after listening to the surprisingly good sound from this set. With the speakers lying around and the availability of so many slots for hooking these up behind the TV set, I did make the connection. Luckily my neighbours are on vacation. 3. Looks: The TV, with the matching stand looks stunning. With its low depth, it is as good as a flat panel TV for people who do not want to hang it on the wall. 4. Remote: The remote is very easy to use and has a lot of controls on it. It was easy for my fingers to get used to this one after being trained to use the Sony for so many years. 5. Controls: The TV has manual and auto channel tuning. You would love the search option where by it keeps showing a small window of 3 channels on the side which playing the cahnnel you want to see on the big part of the screen. Thus I do not miss any action while watching the TV guide for what's next! 6. Connectivity: It is easy to hook up the HD box, computer, DVD player, Tivo Xbox and everything else together on this box. It has multiple s-video, component and composite slots. The TV offers these video connect options to connect the source to the TV. These are listed below in the order of quality, the best listed first: HDMI SVGA Component S-Video Composite 7. Extras: SVGA cable is inside the pacakage, saves a few good dollars. 8. Bulb Life: A few reviews here said that the bulb has a short life. They have mentioned a differnt TV model and not this one. Mine has been good since I bought it and my friend has not had to replace it for 18 months now. 9. Computer monitor: I used the SVGA cable to hook my computer to this TV. With a wireless mouse/keyboard set, am able to use my computer without moving a muscle. What I love even more is that I can surf the net and watch my favourite sport together on the same huge screen.

"After seeing the majority of favorable reviews for these, I bought them.  A huge mistake.  I have now burned 6 of the 50 as music CDs using my computer.  The first three were given to a friend to play in her car -- none of the three would play.  I burned the other three for myself.  Although the CDs would play, some of the songs had a strange type of ""interference"" sound.  It seemed to come up only on certain songs, and only in certain parts of the songs.  Nonetheless, it is sufficiently distracting that neither I nor my kids want to listen to these CDs, which are all going to be thrown away.  Although I should return the spindle (given that I'm batting 0 for 6), the hassle of packaging it and mailing it back isn't worth the time this will take, so I guess I'll just ""eat"" the $20.

"After searching near and far to replace my Panasonic showstopper 2000 (problems with over heating hard drive) I came across an article in Sound and Vision that reviewed the Sharp DV-HR300U.  They gave a very good review of the Sharp and I completely agree with there assessment.  The actual recording on the hard drive looks 10x better then the my old Panasonic. There were only a few quirky things to get used to.  One was that fact that this DVR does not have a menu like Tivo or Replay. You will get a grid  very similar to the Tivo and Replay but there is no listing of the shows.  For me personally it took a little getting used to, kind of had withdrawals. But, once I got past it I was just fine. The Sharp DV-HR300U comes with its own tuner so you can watch your own TV and record on separate channel. BUT **BIG BUT*  if you have cable as I do and your premium channels are 99 and higher then you need to get a little creative.  I had to keep in mind that Sharp made the DV-HR300U more like a VCR then a PVR.  So on my cable box I used the component out for the component in on the Sharp DV-HR300U and record directly off the cable box. I leave the Sharp DV-HR300U on channel three and my cable box on the channel that it needs to record.  Sounds like a pain in the but.. HUH!  Well I would agree with you. and I was ready to return it, until I discovered that my cable box has a channel timer.  Now I  simply set the cable box to switch to the channels I want, at the time I want and set the Sharp DV-HR300U to record at that time and I have my personal clone of Tivo/ Replay type of  user friendly menu. Like I said if it were not for the fact that my cable box would  switch channels for me I would not have kept it.  And that would have been a real shame, because this thing puts out some awesome pictures.  I also like the fact that I am not paying Tivo and Replay the $200.00 life time or $14.99 monthly service to record.  It's a give and take.  =) One last thing to review is the dvd recording.  Simply put its looks great.  Don't expect some of the older dvd players to be able to play the DVD-R or RW.  I nor any of my family or friends had to worry about it because we had dvd players that were fairly new and played the whatever I had recorded.  The software is bit technical but once you understand it you will have no problems.  I have even uploaded home movies that I recorded on my sony digital camcorder.  It's a nice touch to be able to put those home made movies on dvd.. I hope this review helped and with these parting words I recommend it highly as long you can meet the same needs that I had.  good luck ....",5/4/2004,68.0,66.0,AG2RJLFKCJFUU,B0001ZROQM,4.0,0.0,758335.0,21.0,Sharp DV-HR300U  review,0.0,0

"After some moron (me) thoughtlessly downloaded some spyware (the website I went to said it couldn't run without a plug-in that allowed the page to display correctly - this was the spyware, I found out later), I was left with a ton of spyware programs, which proceeded to not only re-direct my browser to God knows where, but also to call back to the mothership and bring in even more software - bypassing the firewall on my machine, no less. So, I bought this software on the recommedation of another, and I must say it's an excellent product. Installation was simple, and it immediately initiated a scan of the system, detecting some 13 instances of spyware installed, and 6 distinct individual types of spyware. It even provided quite a bit of detail on the spyware detected, who makes it, who distributes it, etc. It went on to clean my system, warning me about potential problems with removing some of the components, and making suggestions for action. My only potential 'criticism' of the product is that, at the very beginning, the interface is a little manic (for lack of a better word) - several windows pop up simultaneously, each asking for direction, or to inform me of a new detection, or to tell me some other stuff I can't even remember now. I found this more amusing than anything, and I thought it showed that the makers of this software were enthusiastic about the product, if nothing else.

"After searching for some time for a good piano tutorial software I ended up at Best Buy and, almost by accident, came across Interactive Keyboard written by Laurie Arthur. As a disclaimer, I am in no way tied to the promoter or the promotion of this product. My previous exposure to piano was limited to a group piano course at a junior college and some self-training, specifically with the old Miracle Piano Teaching System which is now obsolete. I have been working with the program for a few days now and I believe I am developing solid technique beyond my prior education. The initial setup was tricky (program loaded fine on Windows '98SE but I needed a MIDI in/out cable-to-USB to hook up my antiquated Kawai KC10 Spectra synthesizer in addition to having to download a driver for the cable hookup, although any modern keyboard should adapt just fine) but once I got rolling I found the program both intuitive and fun. The software package comes with a 222 page manual that is simply loaded with valuable information on technique, music theory, improvisational methods, proper form and exercises, and a host of other information, as well as ""Fifty Famous Feels""; a variety of samples of music in different styles one can playback and with which one can play along. The program seems geared toward the adult learner who is intent on getting a grasp of the piano in an accelerated fashion, though a bright child with some keyboard skills could benefit as well. From the beginning, the program sets out what is required of the student and provides ample exercises at increasingly difficult levels, along with a ""Comp-u-Pare"" facility that enables one to record the recital of exercises (with or without the accompanying backtrack/rhythm) and test her/his skills and abilities. In addition, the software features musical notation of the exercises, a visual/virtual ""keyboard"" that plays the exercise, text explanations of the lessons (mirrored in the manual), and videos that show how to play the exercises. There is more (including MIDI interface tools which I have yet to explore) but I can safely say this is one of the best programs available if one wishes to apply the learning methods to gain a solid understanding of the keyboard at a self-paced level. The writer(s) of this program have clearly done their homework in presenting the student with a valuable tool for grasping musical knowledge best presented on the piano keyboard. However, the instruction seems to go beyond the stoic, stodgy feel of personal piano lessons and slow-paced tutorial softwares into the realm of developing the keyboard player as a MUSICIAN and gaining the ""feel"" of what it is like to control the instrument instead of letting it dictate your actions and feelings. If you are serious about learning piano and music, I believe this is the most thorough approach on the market.

"After seeing it up-close in BRU, I registered for it and recieved it! *** Just a side note, we purchased this swing NOT as an entertainment one, but as a soothing one. We own a travel swing for entertainment *** PROS - The extra infant support. My now 5 month old was premature so this was helpful, and makes it more comfortable! - I love the cradle motion, as does my son. We never really liked the back and fort until around 3 months old, so this was really the only option. - I like the mirror, as does my baby (its a dome, so they really DO get a nice view!) - the mobile is great too, as the birds spin and rotate, and the leaves go up and down and rotate! - the music is calm and soothing. There are also a few volume settings - the removable tray bar has a few toys, which is hard to find in a swing - there are two possitions, reclined, or fully upright. My son now likes the fully upright most of the time - its very stable and adorable! - THE MOTOR IS SO QUIET! I cannot believe people saying otherwise, sometimes you cannot even tell that the swing is moving if the music isnt on! CONS - The mobile is fantastic, but after 6-8 minutes it shuts off and I have to push the button again, I wish it could play until you hit an OFF switch! - Sure the papasan folds, but its more so you can get through a door rather than bring it anywhere! It would be a great improvment if the seat could fold sideways (vertically) so it would be more compact - The toys are kinda boring, and oddly placed. I REALLY wish that the toys were removable so I could feed him easier, and so I could place my own toys on - the swing warrnets a fair chunk of my family room/den! - When the baby was under 2 months, the lowest setting still went a bit fast (slowed it down with dragging blankets) but this seems relivant with ALL swings. All in all I highly reccomend this product, as it is a GREAT place for baby to sleep and relax. I also reccomend purchasing a more exciting bouncer or travel swing for playtime.",7/19/2005,3.0,3.0,AHW628BU4UMKB,B0001IU5HY,5.0,0.0,765418.0,993.0,A wonderful product!,0.0,0

"After searching the web for days for a cd/dvd rack that would help me solve a media storage crisis in my family room, I finally ordered this Atlantic storage rack.  Assembly was fairly straitforward, although definitely not intuitive.  Luckily, my 15 year old daughter was eager to help decipher the instructions. Upon completion of assembly and loading of the rack, I was very pleased with the result.  The volume of items that can be stored is excellent.  In my case, use of the provided dividers allowed access to switches and outlets behind the rack.  It is important to balance the volume of items with the use of the dividers, otherwise, items on the rack will be too loose to be stable.  In part, this is because the rack is made up of rods, not a flat shelf.

"After seeing so many positive reviews of this monitor, even that it was one of the ""must haves"" in a popular baby magazine, I was so disappointed once I got this home.

"After some research and few friend's recommendation, I decided on PIX 501.  It's the lowest model of PIX from Cisco (which fits our small company's need), but it has the same technology of Stateful Packet Inspection as other Cisco Firewall, except at a lower bandwidth. I'm not a network admin, so I didn't know that with a firewall, I need to change all public IP to internal IP in order for it work.  Since this particular PIX doesn't do layer 2 conversion.  So I got my work cut out for me to migration over 50 machines to internal IP, well, it's for the best security anyway.  Should have been done a long time ago before I inherit the network.  Firewall rules are pretty simple, similar to Cisco router ACL.  I wanted to use the GUI, but my friends were against it, they said it's pretty weak.  They're right, command line is better, but nevertheless, I tried the GUI (PDM), it's not bad to see some graphs but for some feature I think it's less confusing using command line.  PDM is written in Java but Java 1.5 won't work, some compatibility issue, you have to use Java 1.4.  I found this out the hard way. It's got some pretty nice feature because of packet inspection, like it checks for ftp command, so bad commands to ftp port gets block.  This will block hacker from hacking using bug inside the FTP server.  Also for FTP, it takes care of ftp ports usage (port 20, 21), none of these active/passive issues.  Passive FTP works w/ firewall, but if both side has firewall w/ high ports blocked, then ftp will have problem.  But the PIX takes care of that issue. Overall, it's a solid firewall, haven't had any trouble with it once it's setup.  Pretty happy with it.  And the unlimited licenses means unlimited IP internally, so we don't have to worry about the license issue.",6/29/2005,4.0,2.0,A2X4IDASPMOM3S,B0000A4F2Y,5.0,0.0,793831.0,1.0,Great Firewall,0.0,0

"After seeing and using so many cloth covered high chairs, one would think that a leather covered high chair would be great.  It should contain foods that are dropped by new eaters and wipe off easily.  As I said, in theory, it's great.  However, the design of the high chair is greatly lacking. This design has a hole in the leather for the bar that is designed to prevent your child from sliding out under the tray.  It also has a design in which the leather comes together in the back, bottom corners.  Because the leather comes together from two pieces, this leave a gap/slit that allows food to be pushed or to fall under the leather padding.  These two holes have been the most irritating, agitating part of owning this high chair. We live in a climate in which we keep our windows open all of the time.  Because of this, small little creatures can get into our home---namely fruit flies and gnats.  These lovely gaps in our $180 high chair have created a breeding ground for these bugs!  We are not dirty people and I clean out the crevices in this high chair after every use.  But, since food falls under the seat, I am having a hard time cleaning it thoroughly after each use. I called PP today to ask about what they suggested to prevent this.  They told me that I should reasonably be expected to remove the screws, pull out the straps and seat belts, thoroughly clean, then replaces everything--including the screws AFTER EVERY MEAL.  Then, I was told that perhaps if I were a little cleaner, I wouldn't get bugs.  So much for customer service!  I don't know anyone with a small child who would think this is a reasonable way to design OR clean a product that you use at least 3-5 times a day! I suggest buying a less expensive seat--perhaps one that can be popped in the dish washer... or even one of those old fashioned wooden ones.  We're currently in the market for one to replace ours--and I can't, in good conscious pass this bug growth zone on to another unsuspecting parent!
