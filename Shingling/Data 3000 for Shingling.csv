600474,A1G2Y1XZHXIW89,0,0,87,B0002YH8AY,10/29/2005,3,16,16,Problem with using printer with multiple computers in a home network - very poor install software,"I have two PCs and a couple of other devices all connected to my home network along with the Photosmart printer. I have a simple home network that's probably like everybody else's - a DSL modem and a consumer-grade Linksys firewall/router/wireless access point.  Sometimes I could print and sometimes I couldn't.   It was very confusing, because sometimes printing worked just fine. I figured it out - when you installed the HP software on each PC, it writes the DHCP-assigned address of the printer (at the time of install) into etc/hosts. The IP address of the device written into etc/hosts is the IP address at the time you run the HP install software, but of course because this was temporarily assigned by DHCP, this may no longer be the IP address of the printer the next time you turn on the printer!! This means the DHCP server will assign the home computer(s) and printer with arbitrary addresses based on the order in which they are powered on. So it is inevitable that at some point the printer will obtain a DHCP-assigned address different than what it was assigned when you installed the HP software, and you won't be able to print! I'm not a networking expert by any means, but it strikes me as **spectacularly stupid** for the install process to write a temporary, DHCP-assigned address into etc/hosts, when the device will obtain a new IP address when the DHCP lease expires or the device is restarted!!! Why does the HP install process *do* this?!?! Given that the default setting of the printer when you take it out of the box and plug it in is to obtain it's IP address dynamically from a DHCP server, and that pretty much every home customer who buys one of these printers will plug it into a home Linksys or DLink router with a DHCP server, it is really dumb for the HP install process to write this temporarily obtained printer IP address into etc\hosts. Gee, almost every home user who purchases this printer will connect it to standard home router like a Linksys, which will be configured with DHCP because that's the default for every home router box. The Photosmart device is a great printer but the software and install appears that it wasn't developed by people who knew anything at all about what they were doing!  It certainly wasn't tested in a representative home network."

Those that won't fit in the sleeves will fit in the pockets up front. Because of the unique design of the locking system however, inserting papges is not particularly easy -- the rings lock in front of the first page, so to insert a page, you have to pull out all of the pages in front of it.  It would have made more sense to have it lock in the back -- that is where you would either want to add pages, or remove the extra ones. All in all, we are pleased ... it is a great way to store our cd's, it gets rid of that major shelving system we bought only for our discs, and, frankly, the discs are more accessible, than in some of those fancy jewell cases. My favorite aspect of the wallets is that we actually listen to our music more -- we were storing our discs in our library -- away from our stereo, so you actually had to make an effort to pull the discs if you wanted to listen to them.  Because these books are so much more portable, they are where our stereo is. I foresee the future holding all music electronically, on demand.  But in the meantime, several of us own thousands of CD's and this seems to be the best way to store and protect them. (PS I understand the hesitation of actually tossing the jewell cases -- all I can say is DO IT!!! It feels fine. And if worse comes to worse, pull them open and save the inserts.)"
600950,A6ILGJICTKQOP,0,1,190,B0002Y6CVA,2/25/2006,5,44,44,Great solution to CD Storage -- get rid of your jewel cases!,"It is wonderful grabbing one of these cases and flipping thru the pages to find my CDs, rather than pawing thru jewel cases, knocking over the stacks of them, and giving up after a half hour of searching.  I have 3 CDW-320's, each holding a different genre of music.  In a fire, I could grab all three cases and go, where that would've been impossible before.  By my calculations, the physical space used by my CD collection has decreased by 40%! The way to do what I did is to get rid of the jewel cases entirely.  To do that, do this for each CD you own: 1)  Each side of each CDW-320 page has four pockets.  Put the CD in one of the two top-most Pockets on a page. 2)  Put the CD's booklet in the pocket underneath its CD. 3)  Finally, pop open the CD case (it takes just a little force) and pry out the back-of-the-CD card.  Straighten out the folds of that card, and slide it in sideways into the bottom pocket, behind the CD's booklet.  It  will stick up over the top of the pocket, but since it's in the bottom and the CD's in the top, it doesn't hurt anything.  The back card will just cover up a little of the CD. Continuing in this fashion will allow you to fill up the wallet with 160 CDs, since each CD takes up two pockets.  Double and Triple CD cases work similarly, and just use up more pocket-pairs. When you take out a CD to play it, you can take out the booklet too, and see the back-card with the tracklisting through the clear pockets.  You never have to take the back-card out, which is good, since its straightened-out folds may be delicate and may rip with too much handling. Finally, you can recycle the jewel cases, saving a few in case you want to lend a CD to someone. One other plus to this one over the other Case Logic cases:  not only is it the biggest, but it allows the pages to be removed and shuffled.  Like another reviewer said, it's a pain, but at least it's doable.  The smaller cases do not have this feature."

The trick for really close work is to get an approximate focus using AF if you can, but then switch to manual focus and move physically to get what you want - I'm thinking here of chasing bugs etc. Of course you have to be patient and you need to practice - just remember your first few shots might be disappointing, although OIS helps Otherwise for still subjects  a tripod will obviously give a better result. Frankly, used with something  decent like the FZ30 this outperforms glass on an SLR costing many times more."
600681,A9Y5O2R4D6EH5,1,0,121,B0002YE6EU,4/8/2006,3,203,213,Canon Monopod up close..,"Never did find more than the one photo of this Monopod on the Internet so thought I would upload some since it arrived here.. Time will tell of course, but it does seem sturdy and the locks are very tight to start with etc.   The mini ball head, while not the quality of one costing what the whole monopod costs.. seems to be capable and holds my heavy DSLR with grip firmly. Again, we'll see what some wear does to it and edit this then. Update after some use.. Well, working very well and clamps are still nice and tight, socket and ball are also doing just fine. I find that I'm not going to leave the monopod screwed in my battery grip while I walk to next shot etc.  It seems to put extra pressure on the grip to camera mount that you don't want. But this is nothing that this Canon product does that another will not however.  No problem if the camera is setting on the monopod, but best not to hold horizontal etc. Update 8/06 Price seems to push high now and then.. my review is based on a price of $30 ,other brands come into consideration at $50 and up. Canon unit is still working just fine and giving no signs of wear or trouble, I'm still happy with it for the price I paid. Update;  July 8,2007 I'd have to move my rating up to 4 stars now as this monopod is still doing well and I have no complaints."

It has a lot of seperate pockets which I like because you can stay organized instead of everything just thrown in one big pocket. It is smaller so it's good for just running around doing erands or shopping.  My pregnant sister-in-law liked it a lot when she saw it, so I got her one for her shower gift! The only thing I don't like is it is not machine washable. If it was I would give it that fifth star!"
600139,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,0,0,54,B0002ZAEYA,10/18/2005,5,37,37,Perfection (nearly) in the palm of your hand,"I had a Palm III followed by a Palm V and I was pretty pleased with both these older model PDAs. After some study, I opted for a Palm Zire 72 and I am very pleased with the features. Important to me, the Zire 72 has Palm's suite of information management applications and the ability to edit Word- and Excel-compatible files and synchronize with Microsoft Outlook (Windows only). This is one reason I got the Palm; my Blackberry is not good as a PDA and I love the easy-to-use and fast PalmOS. The Zire 72 features: 1-megapixel image resolution (1280 x 960 pixels 32 MB of memory --64 MB in the special edition Video capture with sound Digital Voice recording capability. Wireless Bluetooth connectivity to connect to the PC or your Bluetooth-enabled phone 4.8 ounces wieght Palm OS 5.2.8 Operating System Software USB cable for linking to PC Slot for SDI memory card 16-bit 320x320 TFT screen capable of 65,000 colors. Capabilities Rundown: PIM and software: Zire 72 features Palm's suite of information management applications for expenses and note, and it has the ability to edit Word- and Excel-compatible files and synchronize with Microsoft Outlook in Windows. Our own company email system will support the Palm and Pocket PC while it will not be supporting the Blackberry Enterprise System anytime soon. So the Outlook support is very important. Bluetooth: The Bluetooth seems designed for devices to enable mobiles, LAN and PC connections to give web capability. It would be clunky, in my view, to connect via a cell phone, so I'd love to see WiFi. But this feature can be added with a $99 card put into the SDI slot. Bluetooth is not as easy to configure; the set-up wizard seemed to be a bit difficult and there are only a few cell phone models included in the preset configurations. If you can get the 72 connected, you can use it to dial numbers, send SMS, MMS and e-mail, and browse the web using the Web Pro 3.5. Or you can opt for a WiFi card and surf at MacDonalds and Starbucks. Phones that are listed: Sony-E T68i Sony-E T610 Nokia 6310i Nokia 3650 Siemens S56 Not a super list. For PC interfacing or Palm-to-Palm there still is an infrared port. Egonomics: Complaints were made about the blue paint on the regular edition flaking off. I have the special edition with the silver body and this is not an issue. The control is a rectangular navigating button. The screen has the familiar Palm division between screen and stylus pad below. The Graffiti 2 was easy to use--the letters are almost exactly like written print, as long as you know where to begin the the letter, but that's practically intuitive. The sensitivity and accuracy of the stylus-pointing is a huge improvement over the very early Palms like the PalmV. My system came with a Cordura nylon case, very nice quality and a huge improvement from the old flimsy leatherette flaps of early days. Without a case, you have to get something to cover the screen. The stylus is the same type of rod that attaches to the side by sliding into a slot. MP3: You need a SDI card (Secure Digital card) to load MP3 songs with RealPlayer onto the system for playing back with MP3. These are not hard to find, you may even have one floating around the house (we did.) Drag-and-drop songs onto the card on your PC, put card in Palm and go. There is a headphone jack. There are ""speakers"" (tiny) and a voice recorder. Great for memos. Camera: The 1.2 megapixel camera has onboard adjustments for contrast and light (I needed to take down the exposure for a shot of my deck at dawn.) Digital zoom. No cover for the camera lens. The resolution was ok. The memory will hold about 85 shots, and you can move them to the SDI (optional) card. No flash. Software: The installation CD comes with Adobe Acrobat Reader for Palm, plus a calculator, a reader-- Documents To Go which allows you to read Microsoft Word and Excel. It's recommended to download AvantGo to add internet features. Sites such as www.palmsource.com, www.freewarepalm.com, www.palmgear.com, www.download.com have many free or inexpensive applications for the PalmOS. There is no manual, it's on the CD. Summary: For a PDA, this is about perfect. To be perfect, they'd have to include WiFi and or a better phone setup list for the Bluetooth. I am quite thrilled with the Zire 72--it does what I want it to do, mainly be a PDA and keep my appointments and handle some data. The camera and MP3 are nice for travel."

This is for you if you have more than 2 lenses; so I gave it 5 stars because it is very versatile. But; for 2 lenses or less, get a smaller bag. My current bag has a compartment for the camera and 2 small ones for lenses. For air travel, it always traveled on the bottom of my backpack. The Canon bag is a carry-on all by itself.

In this bag, I can put 1) A Canon 40D, 2) a 17-55 lens in a case, 3) a 28-135 lens in a case, 4) a 70-200 lens, 5) a Speedlight, 6) hoods for the lenses, 7) cleaning supplies, 8) at least half a dozen batteries and CF cards, 9) filters for all the lenses, 10) assorted cords, connectors, and remotes... there's still room for an extra quick release mount for the tripod!

Plus, there is 3 side pockets that fit my cords, battery charger, manuals, and an internal fish-net pocket; there's plenty of storage space. It may be slightly too big for some, but if you have your camera and 3 lenses, this is the bag for you. The internal ""pocket dividers"" are adjustable so they may be configured to meet your individual needs. It has a sturdy handle to carry the bag, as well as a very comfortable shoulder strap. If you need the space, or want extra space to ""grow into"", this should be your bag of choice. And almost as equally important is the cost. This bag at any camera store would be 5X the cost..Buy it!! You'll be thankful you did!!"

It was pretty cheap, in fact cheaper than lower models, oddly enough.  The bag itself holds anything you could want, is well padded and weather resistant. High quality metal clips and handles are great.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was the size of it.  This is maybe a plus or a minus for some, but I guess it's a trade-off if you want to carry multiple lenses etc.  For me it was a bit larger than I had hoped/expected and can get a bit heavy when walking around with it for a while like at the airport or a day trip."

XTI body with BG-E3 battery grip attached 24-60 lens with hood 70-200 lens with hood 100 macro lens with hood Extra batter grip insert Spare batteries 580EX II flash Sto fen diffuser Various filters Various cleaning tools Now with all these items packed in there you would think its a tight fit but everything fits perfectly without stuffing or busting the seams and it still has plenty of storage available in the side compartments. I liked the fact that I could keep most of my constantly used equipment in one location at home. If I go out and have no use for all the equipment, I may just take my small bag or holster and shove the big lens in its pouch. The bag is very solidly constructed, no issues at all with its rigidity. One annoyance I do find is the velcro on the sides of the cover. A zipper would have been a better design or perhaps nothing at all. To make things a bit more quiet and easier to access, I just cover the velcro on the lid with wide cellophane tape. This is definitely a nice bag and worth the money, especially now with the price drop. I may grab another as a spare or a gift for someone."

We yanked out the umbrellas (they had been in the bag) and used it to get ourselves back to the car. I was trying to keep myself and my daughter dry, but the camera bag got soaked.

This bag allows for me to have all that at hand, plus my new 18-200mm lens I bought with the 50D, with plenty of room to spare. I have the Canon backpack as well, and this bag does a better job of keeping everything available quickly. This bag is a little large for navigating tight situations with it hanging around your neck. I still have my small Lowepro for when I am just using my 50D with the 18-200 lens, which it fits in perfectly without removing the lens. But for more serious jobs where versatility is required this bag is the best."

However I can fit so much in it. The only thing that I have to gripe about was that the bag shipped without any tags. So it made me question the seller a bit. Nonetheless it's a great bag and I like it a lot.

My old bag has just enough space to hold a camera and flash, but this one's big enough and has compartments for everything; lenses, tripod,(hooks on back and straps underneath) video equipment, flash, a camera or two...However, as a nightlife photographer I find this bag a little too big to be practical when I'm in the middle of a crowd."

I keep my flash and Sigma in their cases they came in and they sit on one end of the bag, I have the set areas for the other two lens and for my camera body only. It fits snugly but sadly I have finally out grown this bag. The extra compartments for storage is very handy. Both sides of the bag are full of batteries, gloves and so much more. I keep all my business cards, extra memory cards, cleaning supplies and more in the front compartment. The inside pocket is where I put my cords and whatever else I need to take with me.

We managed to an SLR, a camcorder, 3 small digital cameras, and all their cords, chargers and manuals in the bag.  There's still a spot for a telephoto lense, too.  Sure, it's big and heavy now, but everything is in one place, and we can grab it and go if need be.  The handles are comfortable, the buckles and d-rings are metal, not plastic.

601038,AR31XITM5XCGC,0,1,58,B0002Y5WZC,6/27/2008,4,0,0,"This is an **Equipment** Bag, Not a Gadget Bag","This bag is not a gadget bag.  It is a camera equipment bag for storing and carrying multiple SLR bodies and/or lenses.  This bag is too wide (almost 10"") and too tall (almost 10"") to use as a light and convenient travel or touring bag to sling around your shoulder.  It's not very collapsible either, keeping its large shape, even when empty. This bag does however appear to be a good bag for an SLR body or two and 1 or 2 lenses, or an SLR and lens with a modern-sized camcorder (5"" x 3"" x 3""), or an SLR and a telephoto lens or two. This bag does appear well made, and doesn't look or feel cheap by any means.  Bottom padding and padding all around is not extremely thick to cover a serious drop, but probably good enough for normal use.  The two end pockets are not as depicted as in the Amazon.com product photo, but are as per a customer's uploaded photo - they have flat flaps that open outwards.  Not great for small items like batteries, but the end pockets are recessed, have elastic bands, and each has space to hold a camera battery travel charger and a rolled up cable. The front two strap buckles are silver/metalic, not black. The buckles depicted in the Amazon.com photo appear black probably because the buckles are relfecting a dark background in the product photo. In summary, this bag is too big to be a tourist/travel camera bag to sling around your shoulder.  Loaded with gear, it will be heavy to lug around.  But it's price (around $30.00) might make it a good enough bargain for those willing to compromise on its size for a decent travel or storage bag."

601032,A2H5IRCSMPUPMF,1,1,52,B0002Y5WZC,6/15/2008,5,0,0,Excellent Bag Once You're Started,"I've been taking photographs for about 4 years now, and in the past three have become serious, investing in several lenses and a Speedlite 580EX II flash for my Rebel XT.  I'm a semi-pro photographer, doing some paid work here and there, but mostly shooting out of fun and personal enjoyment - or being the guy with the camera.  When I first purchased my initial setup, I used an old insulated lunch bag to carry around the camera and short lens.  It was cheap, inconspicuous, offered some protection from heat and cold when shooting outdoors and most of all, was better than just carrying my camera around the neck.  After that, I moved up to an old camcorder bag once I had several longer lenses and the external flash, which proved cramped. The size, price and build of the 200DG is perfect for my needs, now and for the future.  It comfortably holds two camera bodies, up to four lenses (or 3 lenses and the 580EX II), a CF reader in the front, batteries/chargers for the camera and flash on one side and the flash diffusers on the opposite.  As I said, the build of this bag is excellent.  I feel comfortable placing my $2000+ worth of equipment inside and it is logically designed.  On the bottom there are plastic tracks that re-enforce the bag and in addition to that, are two nylon straps to attach a tripod or other larger accessory to the bottom. All and all, if you need a bag to carry all or a large portion of your working gear I cannot suggest it enough.  However, if you want a bag to protect your camera and lens as you carry it with you on a nature walk or throughout your day, this is unwieldy.  Invest in a smaller alternative if you don't need to have several lenses and add-ons with you all the time."

Its nice having the solid bottom with the plastic spacers. plus theres tons of room. I have my rebel XTi with a 18-85mm lens on it plus my canon rebel 2000 film camera plus a 28-80 mm lens and my 75-300 lens. Plus i fit my canon power shot in the side pocket. Then i have 7 rolls of film and i still have more space. The metal clips work great and same with the Velcro. The strap works great. Overall a great bag but it does get heavy just because of the amount of stuff in it.

It's genuine Canon, so if you're big on the name like I am, that's a nice plus.  Another added bonus that I didn't know about before buying is that it has straps on the underside of the bag for a small tripod. You will be able to fit a TON of gear in this bag.  I fit my DSLR camera, 3 lenses, a compact digital video camera, a point-and-shoot digital camera, DSLR charger/battery, camcorder charger/battery, extra media, manuals, install cd's (in case someone wants to see the photos on their home computer), cables (firewire, usb), vertical grip, manuals, and I still have plenty of space left over. The only downside is that when I want to be mobile this is bigger and bulkier than I'd like it to be.  I need to find a bag that will safely fit my camera and one or two lenses, and that's it.

601012,A3L8AWHJ67Q1Z4,0,0,32,B0002Y5WZC,4/15/2008,5,0,0,Great intermediate bag!!!,"I got this camera bag to use with a Pentax K100D Super digital SLR. I have 3 other lenses, a large Cokin filter set, and the usual misc junk. This bag holds it all. You can move the partitions where you want them. It seems to have plenty of padding. If you didn't keep a lens on the camera body, you could carry 2 bodies, 3 lenses and other stuff. It will hold a 70-210 zoom lens standing up. There is about 8 inches of vertical space inside. Some buyers have complained here that the padded part of the carry strap is not moveable. But all you have to do is adjust the length which can be moved at both ends, to move the padding. The strap is nice and beefy. The metal D-rings are nice, as are the metal top parts of the catches on the front. The bottom parts are plastic, but they have to be to bend when they latch. There are tripod straps which I do not use. I would have liked 2 zippers on the external pouches. With one, it is more likely that stuff will fall out when you open them, but the bottom of the pouches is below the lowest level of the zippers, so there is some area below that can't dump out. I would prefer not to have the big Canon logo on the front, for security reasons, but that could probably be removed. I have not tried it yet! It seems to be very tightly attached. There is Velcro inside the top lid, on the sides. Since the lid comes down over the sides nicely, I am not sure what the Velcro is for. It IS very annoying, and mine will be removed shortly. It makes it impossible to be quiet when removing stuff. This would be a pain at a wedding or other public place where you are trying to blend into the woodwork. When loaded, this bag is big and heavy. It will not be handy in close crowds. You will most likely want to also buy a small bag that just holds the camera and a couple other things, for use in crowds and for keeping the camera ready for grab-and-go times. To sum up, if are a serious amateur and you want a nice large bag that seems to be about as tough as they come, grab this one. Pros that have huge amounts of gadgets may want to go bigger."

The front pocket I have a pen, little notebook, lens cleaning supplies and filters in cases. I Still have enough room to place a small 35mm lens in the main compartment. I only have two little complaints that are not major in any way. First, like all velcro things, it is somewhat inconvienant to adjust the dividers inside the main compartment. The second thing are the 'tripod' straps that are on the front of the unit. They are too short and two insecure. I had an outdoor outfitter sew and rivet two substantial black balistic nylon straps on the back of the unit, attached to the top carry straps and the rings on the back of the unit.

The left hand latch does not release unless you tug, wiggle, curse,and tug some more for a good couple of minutes. The right hand latch is normal and releases immediately. In the photo it appears that the latches are metal- not quite. The top part of the latch is metal and the forked part that clips in (picture a dog's collar or harness- it's the same hardware) is plastic.

My last, smaller bag worked fairly well, but not under the gnawing of a Basset puppy, bad dog!!  I love all the pockets on the bag as well as the zipper compartments.  I am able to cary my DVD player and about 15 DVDs.  I have used it on occasion for my SLR and smaller digital camera along with extra batteries, charger for batteries, tiny stand, binoculars and other things I probably don't need.  Even with all that stuff, everything is neatly stored and the bag never seems bulky or overstuffed. I like that the cover has buckle AND velcro closures.  I worried with my last one as it only had 2 buckle closures and kind of small ones at that.  It is very sturdy in its construction.  Others have noted that thier bag was poorly constructed, but, I believe not matter what you make and no matter how well it is made, you will get a lemons in every bunch.  I had a jeep that was such, LEMON!! The price here is sooo much better than what I paid at Best Buy, but, I was in a crunch from the previously puppy crunching on my last bag. I paid almost $90....*gag*. If I ever have to replace my current bag, it iwll be with the same product.  I highly recommend this bag."

600975,A21NCO2G9M4FBJ,0,0,16,B0002Y5YFK,7/3/2005,5,20,20,"A safe, and clean chair!","We were having our ""second"" child, and had NO CLUE of what kind of chair to get since our daughters chair was HORRIBLE!. Well, it turns out we were expecting twins (funny, many ""owners"" have twins) and we knew that we couldn't be cleaning two highchairs daily, especially since the one chair we had for our daughter was hard enough! The wonderful features! *  A removable cloth seat. Its also dark which has proven useful for hiding stains *  A 3 point harness, or as some call it, a lap belt. This belt is attached to removable seat, not to the metal frame *  Two hippos that clamp to the top of your table. They are rubber, so they protect tables from scratches, keep the chair in place, and are pretty adorable. They also make it safe for small fingers! With other chairs our boys were able to reach underneath the grips and pinch their hands! OUCH! *  The chair folds into a carrying bag. This has proven convenient on many occasions, and we found it pretty easy to fold. *  Its lightweight, and fits nearly EVERY table! *  It can hold up to 37 lbs, that's A LOT of child for a small chair! Our opinions *  The chair is so easy to clean. We are able to wipe it with a damp rag after meal time, and it dries in seconds. Its also machine washable, and drier safe! There's also NO nooks or crannies. No matter WHAT reviews say about highchairs, there ARE nooks and crannies in ALL of them! *  The cover is hard to take off, but that's a good thing considering you wouldnt want it to be too easy to remove! *  The chairs really do attach well to any table, and they are easy to remove and place on securely. For the people saying that you cannot eat at a table with one leg in the center, we found this untrue. We were able to either (1) Place the boys opposite of one another, to balance out the table (or if you only have one child, place something heavy on the other end!) (2) place a chair, with a booster seat (given out by the restaurants) under the seats to hold them up, or (3) request a booth and place them inside the booth, which also supports them well. *  Folding isn't something I would want to do after every meal, but its not as hard, for us, as everyone else describes it. It may take 3-5 minutes to fold a chair, but its certainly do-able! And once folded they are very flat, and very easy to travel with! *  The seat is quite spacious, but this is a good thing! A child around the age of 2.5 could probably still sit in the hippos, my daughter is 3 and can fit, but won't sit in a ""baby chair"", that's why I say 2.5! I also love that even though the seat area is large, our 13th percentile twins are able to feel secure! *  The harness is easy to adjust, and I feel keeps them from sliding out! There's nothing for them to use to push out of the seat, and there's really no way a baby/toddler could do this in under 3 minutes, which I feel is a long time to leave your child alone! *  There is no tray. This is very annoying, but we find that the suction cup mats are good enough to protect our tables. And the large gap between baby and the table is also fine. We keep those large/long plastic bibs with the pockets on the boys, so they dont really get messy. Wiping up a mat, and the floor is a lot more negotiable than dissembling a highchair for deep cleaning! *  I would DEFIANTLY say do not use the hippos until your baby can sit up properly, which for our boys was around 5.5 months old. *  The travel bags have proven to be excellent! We have managed to fit both chairs into one bag, which makes hauling them around that much easier! If you only have one, than this assures you that you wont need a diaper bag while going out to a restaurant! I also love that they included it, even if it ""didn't work"". All in all the hippos are fantastic chairs. The boys, now 7 months, are eating at the table with us, and enjoying meal time. We also spend more time with the kids, than scrubbing and cursing over highchairs... A highly recommended product"
600974,ANWPV2JJ49UFE,0,0,15,B0002Y5YFK,7/12/2005,5,14,14,Great quality chair!,"When I found out I was expecting twins, my daughter was under a year old! When the babies were born, she was 13 months old, obviously still in a highchair. I just couldn't clutter my kitchen with highchairs, its not anywhere near small, but I am not sure if ANYONE could truly handle three of them. I figured I would just use booster seats, but my daughter hated the *Three* different models that we bought for her. As a last resort we tried purchasing this hippo hook on, and she loved it! She eats in perfectly now at 20 months old, and since it holds up to 35 lbs this isn't a problem. It brings her RIGHT up to the table, which she LOVES. Its also very comfortable and secure. I had always known it was on tightly, but I worried that my daughter may feel awkward, as if she was dangling off the table... but I doubt this thought ever crossed her mind! The chair is simple to wipe up with a damp washcloth, and I usually get all the gunk out that way. I have owned this chair for almost a year, and I see no reason to wash mine, especially since taking the cover off is such a production! The harness keeps her inside, and not once has she fallen out, or managed to escape, although for a few days her efforts were endless, but she never did it! The chair is also safe on your tables, and the hippos actually attract my daughters/sons attention! The one-legged table thing at restaurants has proved to be a problem... but with three babies, we dont go out much! We found the solution was to just use restaurant highchairs, and bring disinfectant wipes along! We were upset that there wasn't a tray, but after some time of using a regular placemat (its not going anywhere, its underneath the ""hippos"" and has a non-skid bottom) it was just as easy... and less messy, since she couldn't really throw anything off... I also was annoyed at the fairly large gap between her and the table, but she has managed, and it hasn't been anymore annoying than that of the highchair. Her brothers are now 7 months old, and we recently (about 2 weeks ago) brought out two more chairs for them, and they love it! They are tiny, but have been holding up their heads for about 2 months now, so I was positive the time was right. All in all a great chair, that will last for years!"

600972,AN13W2UCFITWM,0,1,13,B0002Y5YFK,2/17/2005,5,10,10,A Must Have For An On The Go Family,"We bought this seat for our 5 month old at Christmas.  She absolutely loves it because she is right there, table level with the rest of the family.  We have used it when we travel, at restaurants as well as a permanent fixture to our kitchen island.  Those wooden seats at restaurants are terrible - always dirty and always sitting lower than the table and with no tray.  This seat just clamps to the table!  Just keep your plate far enough away or you'll have little fingers picking at your dinner.  Every time we've used the seat we've had at least 1 person ask us how we like it and where we bought it.  It's a little bit of a hassle to take apart and pack into the carry case, so we rarely do; unless we're taking a flight or long trip.  It also requires a fairly deep set overhanging bar so that it can fit up against the edge of the table.  If it doesn't slide all the way up against the seat; it leaves a large gap between the seat and table.  This, as you know, is where all of the food and dishes will end up.  An optional tray might be a nice addition in the future if they ever make one.  My island is large and deep so I've had absolutely no trouble and it's one of the best investments we've made in the past 7 months!"

Even with a large kitchen, I couldnt bring myself to purchasing highchairs, although my husband thought there was no other choice... Boy was he wrong! We own two Chicco Travel Seats, and they work WONDERS. We bought them for our home, and they fit under that table, but they wont fit under everytable, just so you know. They are easy to attatch though, the ""hippos"" clamp to the top of the table, and theres also a clamp on the bottom. Its so easy to attatch that I dont leave them on all day, I put them on and take them off after/before each meal! They also hide stains with the dark color, (and match my kitchen decor! no more aqua highchairs!) but unsnaping the fabric seat (tough to do, but thats a good thing! You wouldnt want it to unsnap with baby inside!) and you cna just toss it in the machine! The seat is very comfortable as long as your child can sit up unassisted. Theres a 3 point harness (also known as a lap belt) that keeps the baby contained, but also the design of the chair makes it nearly impossible for baby to get out in that small window of oppertunity with your back turned, simply because theres no where to put their feet to push out. The seats also large enough to hold up to 37 lbs, thats the size of an average 3- 3 1/2 year old! It brings baby right up to eat with everyone, and theres nothing to clean! We dont use a tray (simply because theres no tray to use) but if you put a table topper onto the table, THAN attatch the chair, its the same thing, you just unstick the table topper after and throw it in the trash! I found that theres a little gap between table and baby, but we are able to sweep the floor in about 5 seconds (or if its like pasta we put the pad for under a highchair underneath them, and just dump it outside. This is SOOO much easier than a highchair! It also folds EASILY to be put in a very handy travel bag (see the nice pictures amazon provides) and it can go out to eat with you... Just some tips about taking this out to eat... I wouldnt recomend you putting it on a table without four legs, and most tables just have one in the center. Its also GREAT at picnic tables where other boosters couldnt get too (without a chair that is!) We have brought it to many family gatherings, and it has saved precious space at the dining room table on thanksgiving! This is just such an amazing little seat that can be used way into toddler-hood. Its easy to use, and comfortable for baby... DONT USE THOSE BIG HIGHCHIARS! *****FOR GOING OUT TO EAT OR GOING FOOD SHOPPING YOU SHOULD PURCHASE A FLOPPY SEAT, ITS EASIER THAN THIS FOR GOING OUT, BUT IF YOU WANT THIS FOR TRAVEL, IT MAY POSE PROBLEMS SINCE NOT *EVERY* TABLE WILL ACCOMIDATE IT*****"

It replaced the bulky high chair and we often moved it to the counter so my son could sit and do projects or eat while I was cooking.  After a while the clamp stopped working -- it would clamp on but wouldn't losen to come off the table well.  So, we bought a new one for our daughter. So, even though it did wear out, we liked it enough to buy a second one."

We used it for our travels to grandparents houses and it was perfect.  Fit on all the tables that we used and it was nice having my son right up at the table with us.  One warning is the chair is a bit heavy to travel with wish it was a tad bit lighter, and a little difficult to get off to wash. But once you have mastered taking off the cover it is easy.  I even use it at home sometimes too.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Glad we got it."
600968,A2QDVZ71TNZE37,0,1,9,B0002Y5YFK,1/22/2007,5,4,4,No more highchair!,Our household is very centered around the family and the highchair that we had for our son just didn't allow us to be that at the table. This is the perfect chair for the family that want to eat together. It allows him to sit with us and enjoy family time instead of being two or more feet away. I have had so many people over for dinner now purchasing these chairs. My only regret is not getting it sooner.
600967,A41P590VWKY5C,0,0,8,B0002Y5YFK,6/12/2005,5,4,4,Perfect for a family with young kids!,"We have 11 month old twin sons, and a 2 year old daughter, no matter how much I hoped, there was just no way to fit three highchairs around our kitchen table (sure they could fit in the kitchen, but not at the table itself!) We decided against a booster that uses a chair because then theres 1 (or in our case 3) less chairs at the table. Those also had odd crevices for food, were hard to travel with, and just seemed like the same hassel of a highchair... They also cant go ANYWHERE without a chair, while these can go anywhere with a table! These chairs have proved to be miricals! They are easy to use, you just clamp it under the table and viola! They work best with a table that has a deep lip, some tables wont work, so keep the box incase you need to return it! Luckily, they fit WONDERFULLY on our table, or our large kitchen island! They are comfortable as long as the child can sit up on their own, which my sons have been doing since 4 1/2 months! I found it difficult to fold, but putting them in the trunk of my husbands car, or my mini van was easy, whether or not they were folded. At many restaurants they work BEAUTIFULLY! They also keep your baby off of those dangerous and yucky highchairs! We recomend keeping a chair under the child (preferably with phone books to support the travel seat) because many restaurant tables only have one leg in the middle, making it sort of unstable... but many restaurants would be more than happy to give you a phone book or somthing (maybe even a booster seat to go underneath!). They should make a tray to snap between the two hippos that rest on the table, but for now we use a place mat with suction cups and than clamp the chairs on, this means the kids are kept sanitary, and they keep their food where it should be! The chairs have a lap belt, but the fact that theres no footrest makes it nearly impossible for a child to get out while your back is turned. The cover is hard to snap off (A GOOD THING! who would want it to unbuckle with baby inside?) but is easily spotcleaned, thrown into the wash, and hides stains! The seat can hold up to 37 lbs... thats like a three year old! Food does wind up on the floor through the gap between child and table, but this takes a mere 3 seconds to sweep up, or we keep one of those mats for underneath highchairs (With highchairs food winds up on the floor also) and just pick it up, fold it and let the food slide off, or I just wipe it up with a cloth or with the swifer. I love it, no correction WE are IN LOVE with it! Its an amazing chair, especially for families with more than one child who needs one!"
600966,A38GZ3EMC7R0SU,0,0,7,B0002Y5YFK,11/7/2007,3,3,3,"Pretty good, but not perfect","This is a good, sturdy travel highchair but it could use a few improvements.  First, in order to completely break it down for travel, you need to go through a two step process with little tabs that need to be depressed.  Pushing these tabs while turning and pulling the arms is not ideal, and a better locking device should be integrated. Secondly, and more importantly, the ratcheting grips are sometimes very hard to release even with the locking knobs completely loosened.  The triggers to release the grips often require a lot of force (two hands) while someone else tugs on the grips to release them.  Other times, the trigger depresses easily and the grips just drop by themselves.  This mechanism needs to be refined so that the grips always release easily."

My son was about 10 months old when we first started using the chair. I like being able to keep my son at the meal table. I've tried seating him at various kiddie tables and he is able to stand up and wander away, which can drag out meal times and make it more of a game for him to keep away from Mom.

600959,A37KWI0CFXWO82,0,1,6,B0002Y6ASU,2/9/2005,4,8,8,Reply to other poster,"The reason you might need this is because the Gmini 400 does not come with the remote.  The 400 is a great unit, but I will refrain from covering here since this is about the remote. The remote is great, but severely lacking in one feature: you can not turn the unit on with the remote.  You can turn it off, but not on.  This flaw keeps me from giving it the 5 stars it otherwise deserves.  I hate having to fish my 400 out of my pocket just to power it up when the remote is handy. Other than that, the display is great, and the various knobs perform multiple functions, giving you a ton of control.  I also like the layout and the varying feel of the different functions, which allows me to DJ without looking at the unit. It works for several Archos models and there is a manual for the remote downloadable from Archos' website.  It is a great read if you are on the fence about purchasing this accessory."
600958,A276OKES78FBLH,0,0,5,B0002Y6ASU,7/21/2005,3,2,2,Its OK . . .,"I think its still worth buying, but there's only one line. The thing shows only one line. The song name doesn't scroll, there's not timing information on the current playing media, and the controls can be difficult. Its still worth the convenience of leaving the player in your bag. And the lighted buttons are cool."
600957,ADBMZNUWRC6RZ,0,1,4,B0002Y6ASU,4/2/2006,4,1,1,Overall a good Product,"The main reason I bought the product was because I hated having to take my av500 out of my pocket everytime to change the song. Also you cant change the song on the av500 without turning on the screen so it helps save your batteries for playing songs rather then lighting up the screen. I really like the flick switch that changes the songs. You just flick it forward to change song or hold it forward to fastforward  through the song. To pause the song you just push it in and to play again you push it in and the song starts playing. The fm tuner is good sometimes other times it isnt very good. What it does is turn your headphones into the antenna so the sound quality changes when you move around. It can store presets which it really nice so you dont have to search through the channels. The biggest problem with the remote is that mine makes a high pitch noise when ever the light is on, I dont know if this is normal it isnt enough for me to rma it back so ill just live with it, it is that bad. It is quiet enough that if you are in a noisy area you cant hear it but if you are in your bedroom with no noise you can hear it but it goes away when the lights go off. It takes some getting used to, to figure out how to search through your all of your music pretty quickly. I wish you could switch what the screen says. The only thing that it displays it the song title. I wish there was a way to have it show the artist name and cd. The lights are pretty cool the screen is blue while the other buttons are green so it looks pretty cool at night. I wish there was a way to turn off the light. Over all I really like it and would recommend that anyone with an av500 buy one."

When you wanted to remove a page of discs, you just popped it open and put it into another binder wherever you wanted. Now, with their ridiculous quick-lock system (or whatever the name is that some bozo in marketing made up), if you want to move a page, you have to remove ALL THE PAGES THAT COME BEFORE IT! And these aren't holes in the pages, these are SLITS! It's made organizing my collection a miserable activity. And why did they make this change? Because it's undoubtedly cheaper to make a binding system out of plastic than it is out of metal. And by boasting about the new system, they further insult our intelligence by pretending that it's more desirable and functional than their previous system. It's not. It's better than a case in which you can't remove the pages at all, but that's about it. Case Logic cases are otherwise well made, but this one flaw/change, especially after they'd gotten us used to the three-ring binders, is infuriating."

This is also one of the cheapest 320 disc capacity CD binders on the market.  I've owned this particular model for 10 months now and it has performed EXCELLENTLY! First: the price.  You just can't beat a binder this big for under $30. Second: the quality.  The nylon material shows absolutely NO WEAR after almost a year of tossing it around. Third: construction.  The handstrap does exactly what it should do--make this much easier to carry around.  Outside is durable and the inside is sleek and clean.  Discs aren't scratched by abrasive sleeves and they are NOT bent if they are in the front or the back of the binder--a problem that many of the other binders have. The only con for the whole thing, which I feel bad even saying, is that when you go to zip it back up you sometimes have to 'guide' the zipper for the first inch to get it started.  And this is nothing that you should consider, as with the size of this binder, this should be expected. As far as shopping around, I went out this week to buy a second one of these--for space reasons--and found a Leather Case Logic 320 at my local KMart for $33.  So take your pick. All pros, practically no cons.  If you're shopping around just stop here.  This is as good as it gets."

I have about 600 CD's presently, and have recently consolodated them into three CaseLogic binders. I was given one as a Christmas gift, but was reluctant to dispose of my inserts (for nostalgic value more than anything else). But, I finally took the plunge and began organizing and filing my CD's into these cases. I chose to cut the front page of the insert from the booklets and include that single slip-sheet in front of my CD's. This method provides a really neat appearance and is helpful in locating discs whose covers I recognize by sight. By using these cases, the area occcupied by my CD collection has been effectively reduced my approximately 95%! Additionally, organization is easier to maintain with this system. And, if you need to add a disc at any time (which I assume we all will) the pages are removable for easy re-arrangement! In my opinion, this system of CD storage is far superior to the shelving method that I used for so many years. For those rare CD's which are of extremely high-value, it is not necessary to snip the covers on those. Just because you have the ability to conserve space and organize CD's with this system doesn't mean that you HAVE to with every disc. I have a few such discs that remain in their original packaging. On another note, my first order arrived severely damaged, and Amazon replced it no questions asked. The new one arrived within two days! Amazon customer service is Awesome!!! You have no worries when ordering through Amazon.com!"

The zipper of this unit is a little difficult to ""get started"" when  it is completely unzipped, but otherwise this case seems to be very well designed. I have had no durability problems despite toting this case across the state dozens of times. The only reason this item was rated 4 stars is that I feel it is overpriced. This item could be manufactured and shipped for about $8 each, but the actual cost was quite a lot more than that at the time of my purchase. Still, you get what you pay for, and this is the best high-capacity CD/DVD folder I've ever used."

First, when opened, the zipper retreats to the spine, and becomes very difficult to close.  And the recalcitrant zipper is now on the bottom of the open binder; if you turn it bottom up to work on the zipper, discs start falling out -- because: Second, the plastic pockets do not have a flap on top to secure the disc. And third, you'll wish you had a ring-binder style the first time you have to rearrange your collection.  I've done it twice, and I won't do it again. A much better product is the TekNmotion 400.  It elegantly solves the zipper problem with a zipper extension, it has security top flaps on the pockets, it uses a dual-3-ring system (not perfect, but easier to rearrange).  AND: it holds more disks, has nifty elastic page hold-downs inside, and costs only $20 (not counting postage).  I found them on sale in a local store for $15, so I paid the sales tax and saved the postage."
600944,A1VAF3FRW24H81,0,0,184,B0002Y6CVA,1/28/2009,4,4,4,Case Logic vs. Case-It,"I have a very large collection of DVDs and CDs. I store them all in CD/DVD binders (300+ capacity).  I have used both Case Logic and Case-It binders and each has its own pros and cons. Case Logic Pros - The biggest pro for Case Logic is the way the DVD sheets are held in the binders.  By using two 1-1/2"" plastic strips to hold them in place, it is hard for the DVD sheets to rip out of the binder.  This is a very secure method of securing the 40 pages of DVDs in place.  The individual pages are made of a material that minimizes scratching of DVDs and the extra 16 slots on the inside of the cover are convenient for often-used or new DVDs. Case Logic Cons - The same feature that makes for solid security of the DVD pages is also the most inconvenient feature - the two strips of 1-1/2"" plastic that hold the pages inside the binder.  If you have large collections like me, you will want to add/move pages as your collection grows.  It is a very painful process with Case Logic as you have to remove all the pages preceding the ones you want to move or add, then you have to slide each one back over the strips.  Case-It, on the other hand, has a three-ring binder system that allows one to open it at any point and add or remove pages at will - very easy.  However, the three-ring binder system has its drawbacks too - pages can eventually rip out because the stress on the page is not distributed as well as the Case Logic system. Case-It Pros - Case-It has an extra strip below each DVD sleeve where a label can be placed - allowing one to label the DVD titles right below the DVD - great for those DVDs without an easily readable title on the DVD itself.  It also helps one know what is missing from the collection.  The zipper is also much easier to use - the Case Logic zipper is very hard to close once it is fully opened.  Case-It also breaks its DVD pages into two sections (on the 304-disc series), each one secured by a plastic page and velcro.  If this system is used, it negates the issue with pages ripping out of the binder.  The Case-It binders have a label on the outside that you can mark with its contents - Case Logic does not have this. If you don't move DVDs or CDs around much after you get them in binders, you may prefer the Case Logic system.  But if you reorganize your DVDs much at all, you will like the Case-It system better.  And I believe the Case-It system beats out Case Logic with the small details - labels built in to the pages and on the outside of the binder, and the two-part storage system,  Either brand is well worth purchasing to keep from having to deal with a lot of DVD cases laying around the house - buy these DVD binders and that's all you have to keep around - the DVD boxes can get tucked away in the closet or attic."
600943,A187H9L1FMT314,0,1,183,B0002Y6CVA,11/29/2007,4,4,4,excellent storage for the serious film or music collector,"I've been using Case Logic ""wallets"" to store my films for several years now and am very pleased.  While it is true that the system that holds the pages can be a pain when you need to re-arrange your CDs or DVDs, it is in every other way a huge improvement over the typical 3-ring binder.  These pages WILL stay in place and never tear, come hell or high water. I have five 336-disc cases and three of the 216-disc cases (and three 3-ring binders which I am replacing- I really dislike them).  It's a tough call deciding which size wallet to choose, assuming you need the storage; it's difficult to turn down the extra space as they sell for about the same price.  This is a significant cost difference, as two of the larger cases hold more discs total than three of the smaller ones. But the larger one is a bit cumbersome and awkward and it can be difficult to get started opening the zipper.  The 216-disc case is clearly easier to open, close, carry, and work with. But both are excellent products.  They show no wear and tear after years, and there is no other system that can safely pack more films into so little space.  If my cases were full, I would have over 2300 DVDs on 40 inches of shelf space- that's more than 50 DVDs per inch!!  [NOTE: These numbers assume that you are not using up space in the case for cover art or any of the material that accompanies store-bought music or films.]"
600942,A20WGY00LYI8OF,0,1,182,B0002Y6CVA,4/15/2009,3,3,3,336 Disc CD Case,So far I haven't experienced any problems with the CD wallet. The pages and plastic protective casing that holds CDs/DVDs are a bit flimsy but it gets the job done. Its a bit bulker than I expected.
600941,AY3DGDXUO5N00,0,0,181,B0002Y6CVA,7/26/2008,5,3,3,This is a nice case.,"I'll just jump right into it. Pros 1) Large amount of CD pockets. 2) Hard case shell with nylon that is actually stong. 3) Removable pages for easy organization and for adding more pages(You can buy more pages at Case Logic's site). 4) According to the Case Logic this case is resistant to heat, moisture and tearing. 5) 25 Years warranty. 6) Nice quality, no corners cut in manufacturing. Cons 1) The 16 sleeves that are on the inside of the hard shell case that you see in the picture are referred to as the ""Now Playing"". This is for your most played CDs that you don't put in the pockets of the pages so you can quickly access them. The problem is the sleeves are not tight enough and allow CDs to fall out and the only use I find for them is to hold the CD booklets. So 16 from 336 equal 320, that means you will have 320 places to put your CD's and 16 for you booklets. 2) The zipper is hard to pull but I assume cause it is new and needs to be used more to wear it in. That is about it on the cons. I liked the case so well that I bought another one to hold my PC games. So this is a very nice case and well worth the money."

I bought this cd case before deploying for the main reason that it didnt have the stupid three ring binder type crap on the inside. This thing has been squished and dropped and almost everything in between. The dvd's stayed in place never had one fall out. And the pages are still in awsome shape even after the hords when looking through my movies to borrow. I would recommend this case to anyone thats as tough on stuff as i am. Pro's: NOT three ring binder, holds alot of movies or cd's, comes with a travel cd wallet, holds dvds and cds tight. Con's: Are you still reading this its the best buy you'll ever make. If you are tired of the three ring binder type tearing pages or cds falling out when you travel. Or when the stupid little metal binder parts get a little tweaked and the pages start coming out or the pages snag on the three ring binder part when you are turning pages then look no more BUY THIS. Mine still looks awsome performs great, never an issue and lasted through a 15 month deployment to IRAQ what more do you need."

So I took the plunge and stored all of my CD's in this Disc Wallet.  The mountain of discarded jewel cases will not be missed (or the dust, that kept me sneezing throughout the transfer process). I agree with other reviewers who complain about the tedious procedure involved with adding/removing pages.  It's completely clumsy, but you can manage to do it with a little time and patience.  I also would have liked some sort of ""index pocket"" on the spine of each wallet, so that you could label them (so you would know at a glance which one has A-thru-D, E-thru-H, etc.).  Overall, I'm pleased with the look and construction of them though.  They really hold a LOT of CD's in a very small amount of space.  I can't give any indication of how the pages will hold up under the wear & tear of people who access their CD's constantly.  I plan to use them for storage, and will rarely need to flip thru the pages. In the end, I'm pleased to have reclaimed my apartment (and shelf space).

The jewel cases and dvd cases take up so much room, and jewel cases often become scratched and cracked eyesores. I can put my entire music or film collections into a few cases, and they can be stored easily anywhere. I don't put the booklets in the case with the discs, because it reduces the storage capacity and because cd booklets are often beat up or torn up to begin with. Since the discs themselves are the important thing, these binders make a great and safe storage option. No more endless shelves and cabinets, you can easily have thousands of discs worth of music or film in these cases and store them with little space. A great product for storing and protecting expensive media collections. This is well worth the money."

I don't care about the order; I just stick DVD's into the sleeves in the pages, 8 per page (4 per side). I don't take this case anywhere so I'm not sure how robust it will be in the long run but for home use it is very good. Good return on investment. I'm not totally happy with the zipper location but it's not an issue overall. Good quality. Recommended. Amazon shipping was as promissed."

For those who prefer to keep liner notes, I found that each individual pocket is large enough to hold both a disc and liner note only if liner notes are thin.  As a test, I put 320 discs with liner notes and found the wallet became too bulky, too heavy.  Overall the wallet works well and looks good.

Even with no CDs in it whatsoever, it is easy to see the problems ahead.  With the case open wide, the outer-center support caves in, not allowing for the case to be full with CDs and open at the same time.  In other words, if you hope to store to capacity, forget about navigating it.  I put between twenty and thirty CDs in groups at different spots in the case, figuring I would fill in the spots with similar styles, etc. later.  It just isn't going to work.  I don't know if this is just too large a capacity for any case to hold.  However, I have a case by another company that holds a couple hundred, which I am very happy with.  I will return this tomorrow and order a second of my other case.  It looks like a couple hundred at a time is plenty for any case to hold.  I don't know whether Case Logic's other larger capacity holders are good or not.  I have a couple smaller Case Logic CD wallets that are quite nice.  I think they need to take this one off the market.  It chased me away to another brand for my couple-hundred holder."

I've filled four of these wallets and will be ordering a couple more.  Each page can hold eight CDs and insert booklets although the pockets are a bit tight.  (Forty pages are included with each wallet.)  The rest of the 336 count fits inside the front cover.  The nylon cover is well-made and the zipper works smoothly.  Amazon's price beat any I could find locally.

Not like I have a bajillion CD's, but I put the jacket in front and the CD in back, only getting half of the advertised space.  I would not recommend putting the CD just behind the jacket in the same pocket, filling 8 CD's per sheet as it's very tight and CD's show visible signs of wear much faster. Case Logic folders have always been good quality and I'm a happy repeat customer (upgraded from non-insert CD folders last year). -1 star because of the quirky removable system. As another reviewer poignantly mentioned, they should have stuck with a 3-ring binder system vice front-loading only.  Everyone would find it more convenient to be able to add an insert wherever they need to because even if you don't organize alphabetically, you probably still want to keep CD's from the same band together. -1 star because of inability to purchase more inserts without having to buy an entire folder. If I'm wrong on this and you can purchase additional inserts without having to buy an entire folder to do it, please drop me a comment and share with everybody. Thanks for reading! [EDIT] Was told by Red Sailor you can buy inserts separately.  Not sure Case Logic offers this anymore but that eliminates one of my criticisms.  Thanks again Red Sailor!"

I should have gotten two or three of a smaller size.  When you're turning pages, or trying to open/close the thing, it's kind of unwieldy.

Not the case to keep in your car, unless you want to pull over every now and then to change disks.  Also, it's a bit of a pain to add or remove pages, as you have to remove all pages from the top, not the center like a 3 ring binder does.  The positives - It's extremely durrable.  I was skeptical at first, being the binders are plastic, but it really does lock well.  The case exterior is made up of a very strong nylon, and the zipper is no cheap piece of junk that will unravel after a few uses.  The cds and inserts all fit snug, so there's no fear of your disks all dumping out if it would happen to slip off the seat or table.

I started from the BACK and worked my way forward, allowing for additions at the front of the book where it is easier to make changes. I tried to leave a lot of spaces but realize that eventually I will run out of room and will need to adjust accordingly. The important thing is you don't have to deal with the ring binders as the rings invariably get misaligned, causing damage to pages. Nothing is perfect and you always have to make compromises but I think these compromises are the best for me. Also- there is enough space in the pockets for the cd insert and the cd. This helps me keep the cds organized. I highly recommend this case. Tod"

I had a tough time parting with the cases, but I took out all of the inserts with all of the CD info and put them in the slots with the CDs.

I've bought them before, so I'll use my previous experience with these products in my review. The upside: This has the features I require. - Lots of room - Zips up to close fully - ""Fast-file pockets"" allow temporary storage at the front of the book - Handle - Removable pages - Pages lay flat The downside: It could definitely be better (most of this compares the product to the previous version). - ""Fast-file pockets"" used to be removable; now they are not. - There used to be a spot for a label on the spine; now there is not. - Overall poor quality compared to the previous version. - Binder design only works with CaseLogic's ""patented ProSleeve pages"". - Binder design only allows you to remove pages from the front of the book. That means that, if you want to add a page to the back, you have to take out every page and then put them all back in. Despite the negatives, I believe this product is the best the market has to offer right now, especially in the category of very large CD books. The handle is durable, it zips up fully and the sleeves are removable. Also, the product provides an overall good solution to the problem of CD storage in a way that keeps CDs accessible and manageable. These are the most important aspects to me."

The product is a great buy on Amazon as opposed to Best Buy ($50), seriously! I priced theses products out in other places before purchasing on Amazon and was VERY surprised to learn of the extreme savings - $20. I would recommend this product if you do not want a bulky leather case. I chose this one b/c leather is much heavier and would make the case a ton heavier once filled with CDs.

The quick lock system is slightly annoying, but I keep all of my dvds in alphabetical order, and if you plan ahead, you can avoid moving around pages.

The nylon is smooth and sturdy. The zipper is of good quality, not flimsy. The slots can hold the disks oh so well. It slides in and out with no forcing or jabbing. I've had mines close to 2 years and it's as new looking as the first day. And I use it everyday. I throw it around, kicked it, dropped it, and it even fell out of a moving car and over 2 stories of stairs. No harm! The edges haven't even been bent! Even the Cds were all intact. I've spilled milk, water on the cover and it wipes up easily with a rag and water. The material is so good that my cats don't even want to use it as a scratching post, lol. And they love to scratch EVERYTHING. I love, love the front slots. I wonder how I ever lived without this. The sheets are removable though it may take a while to take out - that's great, makes it harder so they dont' fall out accidentally. I highly recommend this!

600879,A3VWA03ZSBS8ZG,0,1,119,B0002Y6CVA,11/1/2008,1,4,6,Big problem not yet mentioned,"One large problem that I have yet to see mentioned is the following. You will probably be adding your discs in the wallet by Genre, and then alphabetically sorting either by artist or title As you fill the book, every time you want to add a new disc, (ie Carly Simon), but all the spaces between ""R"" and ""T"" are taken, you have to remove all the pages to fit one in where the ""S"" are to accomodate your new disc. In a normal binder where the rings split in the middle, you can flip past the last ""S"" page and add a new page there.  However since these rings force you to add a page in the front, you have to remove them all every time you add a page.  The second problem is that because these pages have ""slits"" for holes and not ""circular"" holes, replacing the pages in the binder is a real pain. Be forwarned.  this is not a problem if your collection is not growing.  But if it is, it will likely quickly grow disorganized due to the difficulty in adding new pages where they need to be!"

I saw this large carrying case in Staples and then I found it on Amazon for less than half the price and free shipping. However, it is really not up to the challenge- the binder is flimsy and the zipper is just about impossible to operate. The pages are minimally capable of protecting the cds- offering just slightly better defense against audio destruction than stacking. Conclusion- if you're as desperate as I was for something that's better than nothing, then  this is the product for you. Otherwise I'd suggest keep on looking."

I still like the case due to its good construction and high capacity, but I store all the DVDs upside down within the sleeve (since the anti-scratch sleeve, along with the plastic lip from the sleeves on the top-half of the page, are what does the scratching), and I have to remove the DVDs very carefully (angling it so that the top of the DVD rubs against the sleeve, instead of the bottom). I think this product must not have been tested very well, and it's ironic that while it's meant to protect your DVDs, it scratches like steel wool! Another thing I disliked about the product is that if you unzip it all the way, then it's hard to get the zipper started again (for the first inch or so) because it just collapses inward instead of wanting to move down the ""zipper track"". The beginning of the zipper probably needs to be more rigid to prevent this type of thing from occurring."

The center strap system to hold the pages in is half genius, half annoying as can be.  The genius part is how the pages flip very smoothly, and don't bind up together (the 3 ring metal binders often find pages getting stuck in the center where they open).  The annoying part is that you need to pull out every page that is in front of the one you want to remove.  The center straps only release in front of the first page, so taking out page 12, would require you to remove all 1-11 first.

If you open the wallet all the way, the zipper gets ""stuck"" in the corner because it's not sturdy enough. It requires some tugging and positioning to get it to work. There is also no way to label these on the outside, so if you have multiples be prepared for lots of openening and closing to figure out which wallet you're in. This just leads to more zippers getting stuck."

I thought it over and realized she was right. Further, I rarely look at liner notes nowadays as I download everything so I went out and purchased the 336 at a big box store.

This is not very durable compared to my older Fellowes case that holds the same number of CD's. The locking system is great. However, if you load your CD's from top-to-bottom, you will need to remove all the pages to add one to the bottom (assuming that page order even matters). I loaded my CD's from the bottom.

My dvds now take up less then 1/3 of the space that they did when they were in their original cases. the case seems well built and sturdy. i have only 1 real complaint. The way that the pages are hooked into the case. instead of using a 3-ring binder style clip they use straps which lock/unlock on one side. this isn't a problem unless you want to add/remove a page in the back of the binder. you need to remove all the pages before the one you want in order to get to it. other than that it seems like a nice case.

It is sometimes a little annoying to start the zipper to close the case: it's not that it doesn't work (it works fine), but the fabric isn't really stiff enough to hold its form sufficiently for it to start zipping easily; I have to fiddle with holding the fabric in place, so the sides of the zipper track line up, to make it go.

The handle is kind of stupid as it doesn't hardly give enough room to fit a hand under to carry.

I am methodical about the storage and organization of my CDs and this was the perfect thing.  It is durable and has survived my dog (a yellow lab) which is saying a lot.  The only reason that I did not rate it 5 stars is that I have to remove all the pages when inserting a new page to keep the CDs alphabetize.  I was aware of this from other comments so it is not that big a deal.  A good buy for what I need.
600773,A34RREM7D9GN05,0,0,13,B0002Y6CVA,12/10/2005,5,0,0,gotta buy another one...,"the first cd wallet of this magnitude i ever bought- was the fellowes one. (my review is in there somewhere) I have two of these case logic wallets now (i bought one on sale @ amazon and my friend sent me one from my wish list). I'm ordering a THIRD case logic case because they withstood hurricane Rita... well... actually there wasn't much of a hurricane in Houston - BUT i did have to lug all of three of my 320 cd wallets around during the evacuation. (house to car to 2nd floor apartment to car to house) both brands are made well- neither of them broke during the evacuation- which is amazing seeing as how- with all my cd's and dvd's inside each wallet weighs 17 to 18 lbs. I have decided to purchase another case logic cd case- for many reasons... 1. The Fellowes is made well- but you can't take pages out and organize them. The case logic case- you can- it's a pain in the butt though- especially if you want to change a section in the very back... but it's still nice to have the option- and still way better than having to move the cd's out of the sleeves. 2. The Fellowes is made well- but the construction doesn't have as much heft to it as the case logic. when both are empty and you're holding one in each hand- the case logic is a little heavier. the case logic- has nicer smoother nylon feeling fabric- rather than the coarse canvas fellowes. the case logic's has more seam reinforcement. the fellowes has a little bit more padding- but i don't really see how it makes any difference in protecting the media inside. 3. both are difficult to zip- and i'll probably have to rub soap or wax on both brands eventually---- but the thin fabric on the fellowes makes it REALLY hard to zip- where as the case logic - has more hefty fabric which instead of moving with the zipper pull- it stays in place. 4. the binder like quality of the case logic- allows you to use this case frequently without fear of damaging or ripping out pages- ie... flipping around for half an hour trying to figure out what dvd you want to watch. i keep cd's in the fellowe's one- because it's just for storage. (I highly recommend the 4gb ipod nano opposed to the 2gb fyi) i would NEVER get a fellowe's to house my dvds. These two case logics get thrown around a lot... literally because they're heavy. the pages get smacked around- back & forth, back & forth...  they've taken a lot of abuse and that is why this case get's a 5 star rating. i know if i used the fellowes case for my dvd's that thing would have been broken after the first month."
600772,A1NV3UW4IVPB94,0,1,12,B0002Y6CVA,11/9/2008,5,1,2,"Functional, yet melancholy","I rated this item a 5, which Amazon translates as ""loved it"". But can one really be said to love a CD binder? This item is squarely in the realm of the functional: its rating comes not from being loved but by performing the task as advertised. The last several (and growing) albums I've bought have been MP3 downloads ( , , etc.) An MP3 download comes with no case, no insert, and a severely downsized piece of ""cover art"" data. There's no physical storage needed, other than the hard drive in your computer. And 1TB drives will be down into the ""impulse purchase"" range next year (2009). We plan on consolidating several pieces of ""home theater"" equipment next year, by putting together an HTPC (home theater PC). It will, of course, act as a digital jukebox for the entire house, storing our combined music collection as magnetic fields instead of atoms. This means, of course, ""ripping"" through our existing CDs. In 2009 it's not ""cool"" to flash your music collection on countless shelves; you flash the newest iPod instead. That's the future, but traveling to the future always carries with it your accumulated past. Part of our accumulated past is the vast amount of music we've accumulated on plastic circles. (I also bring with me an LP collection; my wife is bemused.) Once our music is firmly ensconced in the realm of the digital, the discs themselves become a curiosity, a mere token of ownership, and possibly a reminder of certain times in our journey through life, should any particular album hold that kind of emotional resonance based on when it was purchased or received. Even as I take the discs and booklets out of jewel cases and slot them into the sleeves, I find myself wondering ""why even keep the booklets?"" In most cases they add nothing, some ancillary art of photos, perhaps, but nothing you'll ever think about as you page through iTunes. I suppose if you wish to devote time to keeping the discs in a pristine order as your disc collection changes, then perhaps the criticisms voiced by other reviews will apply to you. In my case, the ultimate fate of the CDs is to sit in the closet, taking reasonably little space, with some of the booklets kept for nostalgia. So for my purpose, this product fits the bill. Perhaps it will for you as well."

600754,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,0,0,3,B0002YACFC,1/27/2005,4,13,13,"Stylish and media-savvy, but not perfect","Sony's new T-series VAIO ultraportable laptops replace the camera-included TR series, which has been discontinued.  There are currently four models in the T-series: T140, T150, T160, and T170.  All sport the same casing (no surprise), same weight (3.1 lb. incl. piggy-back battery but excl. AC adapter), same processor (the new Intel ultra-low-voltage Pentium M 733 (based on the Centrino, not Pentium IV, running at 1.1Ghz but with an amazing 2MB level-2 cache!), same screen, and same hard drive (slow-ish 4800rpm 40GB shock resistant drive). The differences among the models are as follows: - The 140 and 160 come with a DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive, so you can't burn DVDs. - The 150 and 170 come with dual-format DVD burner/CD-RW drive, so you can burn both the plus and minus formats of DVDs. - The 140 and 150 come with 512MB of RAM. - The 160 and 170 come with 1GB of RAM (max the T-series can take). - If there's a ""P"" after the model number (e.g., VGN-T150P/L), it means the computer comes with WinXP Professional installed.  The absence of ""P"" means you get WinXP Home. - The ""L"" after the model number signifies the color scheme.  Most of the T's come in what Sony calls ""midnight blue,"" a stylish color that gives an understated emphasis to the exterior.  On Sony's website (sonystyle.com) you can special-order a T150P/T that has a burgundy exterior, which looks really ""hot."" All the T-series VAIOs are designed with two primary goals in mind: ultra portability, reflected mainly in the travel weight; and multimedia capabilities.  In fact, VAIO buffs will recall that VAIO stands for Video Audio Integrated Operation, which (I presume) in Japanese means a multimedia-centric computer. All the T models are equipped with an optical drive.  Only a year ago, the only ultraportable with a built-in optical drive was the 2.8lb. Panasonic ToughBook W2 (which, as you'll see, is still my favorite ultraportable, for lighter weight and bigger screen).  I personally recommend a 150 or 170 with the dual-format (not dual-layer) DVD burner.  These days, whether you burn personal videos or backup files, a DVD burner really comes in handy.  Of course, if you plan to use the VAIO T as a secondary computer for Starbucks or Barnes & Noble or flying, you can save yourself $150 by skipping the DVD burner.  (You still get a CD burner with the 140 and 160.) The VAIO T's are very stylish.  Except for the protruding battery which seems like an afterthought, the notebook is well designed and well built.  You get both 802.11b+g wi-fi and Bluetooth built-in, as well as an i.Link port and a MemoryStick slot.  (Too bad Sony still refuses to support the much more popular Secure Digital format in their laptops.) The T's screen is amazing.  Well, it's both amazingly small (only 10.6"" vs. the Panasonic W2's 12.1"") and amazingly bright, easily viewable outdoors.  The widescreen resolution is 1280x768, great for watching DVDs but a pain in the eye for doing your everyday work.  (You may want to turn on Windows' built-in font-magnification function, via the Accessibility control panel.  Also turn off font smoothing.)  I get eye strains from reading e-mails and surfing the Internet.  Panasonic W2's 12.1"" screen seems so much bigger.  Like most ultraportables, the T uses shared memory for video, so don't expect to play Doom 3 on this. The keyboard on the T is shrunk to accommodate the small footprint of the ultraportable.  I had the 2.7lb. VAIO N505VE before so I got used to the small keyboard quickly.  If you are a touch typist who's never used a 90%-sized keyboard, you might be unhappy with the size, at least in the beginning. Performance is snappy on this laptop despite the many plug-ins it comes with; the new processor with its enormous L2 cache and the generous amount of RAM surely help.  When you get the 1GB versions, the performance is simply great for a laptop this size. Sony should be lauded for getting some amazing battery life on this machine, but spanked for making the battery stick out in the T's rear.  I watched a 3-hour DVD movie (with wi-fi intentionally left on) as I sat in a B&N cafe.  After the boring movie ended, the T still had plenty of juice left.  Just amazing. So, in short, for about two thousand big ones, you get a multimedia road warrior that will turn heads in cafes and on the Amtrak (and might even invite a mugging or two if you are in the wrong neighborhood).  The small screen is amazingly bright, and the stick of a battery powers this laptop for good hours.  If you want an ultraportable, I still recommend you look at the Panasonic W-2, which is even more stylish (I just love its circular, under-the-keyboard DVD loading), has a bigger screen and weighs less.  But if you want an ultraportable with a built-in DVD burner, the T is probably the best you can get right now. (I also like Fujitsu laptops, so you might want to consider the Fujitsu Lifebook P7010 ultraportable as well: cheaper, 80GB hard drive, fingerprint sensor, SD/CF/MemoryStick slot, up to 10.5 hours of battery life!) I hope my quick review helps you.  Feel free to e-mail me at hotmail with your questions."

It's small enough to take on many journeys & not dread the weight hanging off your shoulder. The wireless capability is super easy to use. The screen quality rocks! The DVD writer/player is a great way to add value to this gadget. With 1 Ghz processor don't expect to have Photoshop and 4 other programs open but it does great with 3 MS office products open & IE. Also I recommend you buy the system with 512 & upgrade to 1GB aftermarket. This,laptop only comes with 1 512 SIMM but accepts 2. The battery power is good. The keyboard is cramped...if you don't hunt & peck it might drive you nuts. The speakers bite...so either buy headphones or an aux. set of speakers. I highly recommend the system though if you want a gadget that wows, pleases and can be conveniently packed in almost anything but the pocket of your jeans."
600752,A3J2BEEEMQEK20,0,1,1,B0002YACFC,1/9/2005,4,2,2,Ultra Portable Laptop For Work And Fun,"Pros : Light (3 pounds), small, beautiful screen, great wi-fi, sturdy, good battery life, dvd burner, great dvd playback, widescreen, fast for Office MS, IE, Itunes, even games such as Rise of Nations and Age of Empires, great looks, dvd and volume controls, nice all around design, attention to detail, 2 USB 2.0 and 1 Firewire, video out. I mainly use it for Office, IE, a few strategy games, sync with my IPAQ, sync with my IPOD, burn DVDs and CDs, whatch DVDS, listen to Audiobooks, Outlook, and digital pictures editing and managing. Cons : runs hot after a while (one of the ventilation slots on the bottom), keyboard a little bit cramped but you get used to it after a while, only 40gb HD - could have bigger options (will buy an external VAIO HD) thinking about it, I prefer small and light with an external HD at home or even take it with you on your trips, so this is not such a bad deal. In conclusion : This is a great little machine. Ultra portable and powerful. Built with great quality. Before this one I had a Dell Inspiron 8200 (big and heavy), and after using the Vaio T I will definetely never go back to a big laptop or buy from Dell, and I will surely buy from Sony again. In the end, just a few drawbacks because of its size, but hey, nothing is perfect, right ? If you want Apple looks and design but want to keep using Windows, buy a Sony."

Tell Me More German isn't just the Cadillac of German language learning software, it's the Mercedes, BMW and Porsche all rolled into one.  This software may be frustrating for those who want to learn some basics before departing on a relatively brief trip overseas.  If, on the other hand, you want to immerse yourself in as many aspects of German as possible to achieve both cultural and literal fluency, then search no further than this product. How you approach Tell Me More German is the key to either a) your success, or b) your frustration.  If you expect side by side translations spilling over with grammar rules as you go along, this package will not work for you.  If, on the other hand, you remember the oral (aural?) and visual cues given you to learn English followed by written reinforcement, you will be far more likely to succeed.  As someone who has had more than a fair share of introduction to the German language, I concede that this product might be easier for me to use.  However, what I learned in German helped me immensely as I approached Tell Me More Dutch, although I didn't expect this to happen when I began using that package. The combination of Tell Me More German's spoken analysis, use of videos, written exercises, drills, etc., are a clear indicator that this package is for serious German learners.  Read the screen prompts, follow the instructions, repeat lessons when and if necessary, and you will be well on your way towards total comfort if almost any normal situation if and when you travel to German-speaking Europe. Between the linguistic, cultural and historical information provided in this package, the cost is miniscule compared to what you would have to pay at the university level to receive the same education.  I have only one recommendation:  buy a high-quality headphone/microphone combination to get a more accurate interpretation of your accent.  The encouragement provided by the language-recognition software is well worth it. All-in-all, there is no question why toptenreviews.com awarded its highest honors to Tell Me More German.  In fact, the only language in which Auralog has not claimed the #1 spot in language software on toptenreviews.com is Russian, and that's probably because there is no Tell Me More Russian on the Market.  When there is, I am certain it will join its bretheren."

Once I read the reviews and found TeLL me More, I decided to give this program a chance. I'm glad I did! Coming back to German after many years away, this has been a great re-introduction into the language, as well as an assessment tool to determine what my skill level is. While I would recommend it to all learners, I do think those with no language knowledge at all might have a tough time initially with word associations, but eventually, hard work should pay off. The included headset is of sufficient quality to work with the program. I love the phonetics although the grading scale is sometines sketchy--in my opinion--I cannot always tell the difference in how I pronounce something that's graded w/full bars VS. one on which I might be graded only 3 bars. At first I was afraid I'd run through the program too quickly but after seeing the extensive exercises and still being in the beginner level, I obviously don't have to worry about that anymore. I also like the workflow of the guided mode. So far, the only thing I would like improved is the print feature. It literally prints a screen shot of what it sees, I'd rather it be able to print the whole list of what I'm looking at so that I can easily take it with me for study.

Readers should understand though, that before I started with the software, I had taken 150 hours of lessons from Berlitz & had been living in Germany for 6 months.  So that being said, I cannot speak to how well this product will work for extreme beginners.  This product helped me expand my vocabulary, practice my speaking, improve my grammar and learn more about the country in which I am living.  This product will not make you a fluent speaker, only actual speaking can do that, but this product will make you feel more comfortable with in hearing, reading and writing the language.

You know teaches you basic words, how to say them and what they mean and then gradually work up to putting words together to make sentences.  This isnt the case.  It jumps right in to sentences and phrases, luckily I understood what was going on, at first.  Right now the program is teaching me how to pronounce words and not even giving me the meaning of the words I'm trying to say.  It does have a glossary where you can look up the word your pronouncing but it takes several clicks of the mouse and a few pages have to load to get to it....good luck remembering how to spell the word your trying to research by the time you get to the glossary. Once you leave the glossary your not even going back to the same part of the lesson you were in anyway your starting over.

I do however like that the program keeps track of your scores and gives quizzes. I also enjoy the speaking portion of the software, but it would be better if it could record and play back the world as you're learning it. Overall I would say this program is mediocre.

It takes a fair amount of time to sort through loading on your computer and such. Once it is installed, you go through all the processes of setting up the program, entering all your information, purpose for using it, etc. After all that, you think you are reading to learn a language. To the contrary, this is how the very first beginner level went. I want to be specific so everyone is very clear on how bad this program is. It shows a picture and then 3 sentences next to it. These sentences are complete sentences with subject, verb, and so on. At the top, it says to carefully listen to each choice before selecting an answer. In the end, you will find out there is no question and no place to select an answer. There are just the 3 sentences. All 3 sentences actually apply to the picture. If you click on one, you are not submitting an answer like it says, you are having it say the question outloud. After you go through several pictures and sentences, it gave an activity. At this point, it still has given NO instruction at all, just pictures and sentences. One of the pictures was as basic as a set of books just sitting in a pile. The activity also had no learning value. It was a word search. There was a list of words in the target language and then you searched for them. That was it, nothing to help learn the words at all. The next activity was a series of sentences with a word missing. There was a multiple choice of words to pick to fill in the blank. Remember, no instruction of the language has been given at all. Many of these sentences were verbs. No instruction on the language has been given at all, let alone verb conjugation. (I already know the target language, I got the program for my teenager who will be taking the language in school next year). You click on your answer. It did not really tell you if you got the question wrong. I knew when I got it wrong because I already knew the language and was able to, on  my  own, because of my prior knowledge of the language, tell that the word changed to one color if correct and another close-in-color if it is incorrect. It never made a sound to indicate it was incorrect nor did it give a correct answer or a chance to select a different word. It simply then went on to a different sentence. About tech support. I spent the week attempting to call the tech support number. You would think that someone there had used the program at some point. NO ONE I spoke to had ever used the program. At most, they signed in. One person explained to me that she spent a fair amount of time in training, but it was all about installing the software and setting up the program. I spoke to several people at Tell Me More and no one there had any clue about how the program was supposed to work. Two times, I was transferred to someone that I was told might know how the program is supposed to work. It is Friday night now and I never heard back from either of the two people that I left messages with. I find it amazing that the people at the company itself, at the technical support line, have never used the program beyond installing it and have no clue how the program is supposed to work. Please save your money and frustration. Of anything I have ever purchased that I can recall, this was the biggest waste of money and time. And if nothing else, any place with such a rotten technical support staff, rotten training of their staff, you will be 100% on your own with this non-refundable software program."
600734,A2KYA1J1PUML2L,0,0,4,B0002YAZCM,12/30/2007,1,2,4,Tedious and annoying,"I found this product to be simply tedious and annoying. I've learned a little german through Rosetta Stone german for dummies, and wanted to be able to become atleast proficient in german. With all the praise this product got i thought it would be incredibly good. However when i started using this program it would start u off with vocabulary that you've never learned and when you use the translation key it gives you five or so translations for each word, making it even more confusing, and then you would get crossword puzzles that included tons of words that the program hasn't even taught you yet, so i would try to look them up, but many times i would not be able to find the right word to fit the number of spaces, and even if i did, i would rarely remember what the word was. Then there were these exercises where you would have to type what the speaker was saying down: first they spoke way too quickly for somebody learning the language, and second, if u had one little tiny mistake in how you typed the sentence (you forgot to capatalize a letter, forgot the period, spelt a word a tiny bit wrong) it would mark the ENTIRE sentence wrong, they also used many words that you've never learned yet, and i don't get how hearing words that you don't know is going to help. Also if you were trying to find any words in the dictionary you would have wait a minute or two for it to load and then search for your word, and then go back to your excersize that you would now have to start all over again. Plus it would also give you grammar excercises on grammar its never taught you. The entire program never really teaches you anything unless you spend a long time trying to find what you want in the grammar excercises and memorize them and memorize the dictionary which is a complete pain. I was frustrated so much by this program that i emailed the company to ask where it teaches you the vocabulary, and she just said it teaches you as you go along, which doesn't happen at all. In short, save your money even a simple book like Barron's Learn German the fast and fun way for $18 is much more effective at teaching you german then tell me more german."

You have to dig around in it trying to find what you're looking for. I could go on and on. I'm very glad I got mine as an overstock. I would be FURIOUS if I paid full price for this.

If you're new to macro photography I might recommend the Nikon 6t, but if you want the most powerful macro lens in its class, go with this one.

Using the Super Macro does demand greater patience & stability from the photographer; and one has to take some time to 're-learn' the new limits of depth of field/focus for one's favourite camera when employing the lens. However, if you are a serious macro photographer you are probably employing due diligence in this area anyway. The resulting images are extremely crisp & clean. I haven't had any occasion to complain on any aspect of the quality of the images provided I take enough care to ensure that the subject is correctly in focus. My decision to buy this lens was also motivated, in part, by the Snap-on Universal mount that goes with it. It really is snap-on and significantly reduces 'mounting' time. I'm really pleased that I don't have to screw the Super Macro into my lens threads. Highly recommended for the serious macro photographer."

A passing interest in macro has become a passion for macro. I can't speak for this lens on other cameras, but I have seen 3 Kodak models produce very nice images with it.  It took me minimal time to adapt to the change in focusing and although I still occasionally get a very small amount of vignetting at the proper focus (shadows in the corners of the frame), this can either be edited out of the picture with either a clone tool or a very small amount cropping.  Most of the time however this is not needed.  An adaptor will be required to fit this lens on your camera--these usually are very inexpensive. I'm very pleased with the results I've gotten with this lens and think this is an excellent value, the product performs very well.  I added one of my pics to the gallery."

Using it on my 18-55 mm Canon lens, I got 1:2 magnification, which is good, but not amazing. Most of the times I am using it with my Sigma DG 70-300 mm zoom lens, and in this setting the DCR-250 achieves an amazing 3.5:1 magnification ratio! (in both cases I use maximal telephoto) With this amount of magnification come a few problems: most importantly, the depth-of-field is extremely small. Lowering the aperture as much as possible will help, but you still have trouble getting even both eyes of a bug in focus at the same time -- people often combine multiple exposures to obtain the incredible bug shots that you can find online. Of course, lowering the aperture also means *very* little light will get into the camera, so you most likely will need to use an external flash when taking macro shots (the internal flash will likely be hindered by the lens + macro lens combination, since the focusing distance is about 10 cm with the DCR-250). There are also ring flashes, specially designed for macro photography. In a word, this is a very good alternative to buying a much more expensive dedicated macro lens. The adapter that comes with the DCR-250 allows it to attach to basically any lens, and you can actually successfully use it with many point-and-shoot cameras. It takes a while to get used to it before you can take great shots, but it's worth it."

I also own a Raynox DCR-150, which gives less magnification and nicely compliments the 250.

But with the MP rating of most cameras these days, the amount you'll need to crop will still leave plenty to work with for prints.  Otherwise, it seems reasonably priced for what it offers, build quality is excellent, the snap-on universal mount is exceptionally convenient and the clarity of image magnification it offers is superb. Depending on what lens you're using be prepared to hunt for that elusive slice of focus where the subject comes into sharp detail.  I wasn't expecting to have to get as close as I did to find it, so I was initially seeing nothing but blur and not sure how to fix it.  Just start from a foot or two out and slowly move in (with your body) on the subject until you find the focus. While others have suggested sticking to manual focus, I've found that autofocus can still be helpful if you're handholding the camera.  I coarse focus manually by rocking back and forth with my body, but autofocus helps me fine focus once I get within range of sharp DOF. I have bought this lens initially to use with a Nikon D90 + 18-105 kit lens and so far this seems to be a very good combination."

I realized you have to zoom in on your subject and be about 5 or 6 inches away and then your image will be clear. I later found out it will also attach to my kit lens for the Canon XTI and today I was very pleasantly surprised that the DCR250 lens screws into my Canon HG10 HD camcorder.

The photographic results I was able to achieve with this lens exceeded my expectations. A distance of about 5 to 7 inches from the subjects with a Canon Tele 300 mm lens are nothing short of remarkable. Important note here. The Raynox DCR-250 works best in a lens tele range of 150 mm to 300 mm; at least with my gear. My personal image results have been best when using it in conjunction with a tripod and manual focus.

Focusing is very difficult and I found that the best approach for me is to set the focus on manual, put the camera on a mono-pod and then rock backward and forward until the picture comes into focus.  Once it comes into focus, then I need to try to quickly take the shot using a cable release before it slips back out of focus. It's a frustrating and tedious process that produces a high ratio of bad-to-good shots.  Because the process is so time consuming, I think this lens will have fewer practical applications than I had hoped."

600708,A3MJDPUJWJ9BQG,0,1,2,B0002YDUYM,3/18/2006,2,2,2,Sorry I Bought this Printer,"I bought a 1200dtwn in January. My previous printer was an HP 990Cse that never gave me any trouble and still works beautifully. The only reason I got the 1200 was for the network capability. The 1200dtwn is a ""sensitive"" and complex machine. For several weeks I have had a problem where the Toolbox ink level display for 2 of the 4 inks shows as zero even though this is not possible. The other 2 inks show reasonable numbers of 74 and 91 percent. The HP support people had me upgrade the printer's firmware to a level that corrected a problem where the ink levels displayed as zero. This firmware upgrade did not solve my problem. In fact after installing the upgrade all 4 inks displayed zero percent ink and when I printed a test document I could hear it printing but nothing appeared on the paper. Fortunately I had come located a 5-step procedure to reset the printer. This is an absurdly complex secret ritual-type of procedure. After resetting the printer I was back to where I was before installing the firmware upgrade, with the Toolbox showing 0 percent for 2 of the inks. I think the firmware upgrade may have corrected the problem I had after an envelope jammed, inside the printer- where all the printer's indicator lights were lit (this condition is not documented) and the printer refused to do anything - it wouldn't even turn off. Another problem is that characters are shifted up, a little too high, in a column near the center of the page. I haven't even begun hassling HP about this problem yet. After presenting one problem to HP Support they came back with the procedure shown below. Keep in mind that there are 2 media trays, 4 ink cartridges, 4 printheads, and one duplexer. This is a small project that did not solve my problem anyway. I am very sorry I bought this complex and incompletely debugged printer. =====Start of Diagnostic Procedure================================= ""In order to troubleshoot this issue, I suggest that you remove all the user replaceable part (for example: ink cartridges, printheads, trays and duplexer). Unplug the power cord from the printer and clean the electrical contact of the printhead and the socket."" Refer to the section ""Cleaning the printhead contacts or replacing the printheads"" in the document at following URL for information to clean the electrical contacts: http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c00170880 Please follow the steps below after cleaning the electrical contacts of the printheads: 1. Reinstall the trays and the duplexer. 2. Reconnect the power cord and turn on the printer. 3. Reinstall the ink cartridges and then the printhead. 4. Ensure that printhead latch and all the top access covers are properly secured. 5. With the printer turned on, unplug the power cord. 6. Wait for few seconds and plug in the power cord. 7. Turn the printer on by pressing the Power button and check if the printer comes to ready state. =====End of Diagnostic Procedure================================="

I just tried out my new 1200dtwn and its printing quality is equal to the 970.  It uses the same color technology,  PhotoREt III, that was in the 970. Setup was easy.  Uses 4 ink cartridges and 4 printheads, easy installation.  This printer is a bit larger, about 17 X 18 X 11 with 2nd tray, but is a good buy if you have the room in your home office."

This GE model was inexpensive ($25 at a local store), ergonomically designed, and full-featured.  I'm very pleased with it. Reading the instructions, nothing to do with the phone is difficult to manage, from installing the 4 AA batteries (just my luck the old phone used AAA for which I had a gazillion rechargeables!) to using the caller id functions and storing numbers in memory. The phone is easily configured as a wallphone or a desk phone, with a reversable wedge-shaped pedestal making reading of the display simple.  I've had no trouble with the phone, and the handset volume and sound quality has been excellent.  To date, I have not tried the speaker phone, but neither have I had any trouble with it ""automagically"" turning on, as mentioned in a previous review.

I like the digital tuning -- BUT -- this unit has a problem.  The surface buttons for turning on AM and FM radio are easily bumped, and if yhou are carrying this around in your backpack, you better have the  ""lock"" button on or you will certainly drain the battery.  I have gone through about six sets of batteries simply because it gets switched on so easily.  Another problem is that if you want to clip it to your belt, you need to put it in a holder because the unit itself does not include a belt clip.  This means that you need to take it out of its holder to turn over the tape. Bottom line... a useful cassette player, but it has a few design flaws."

This item is one of my favorite accessories for the camera -- so much easier to travel with than a tripod! It's sturdy, but lightweight, easy to use and is very portable. I am mostly using the monopod to support my camera with an enormous, extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached. I'm actually able to hold that huge lens steady with just the monopod -- not one blurry photo! I've dragged it all over the Bluegrass of Kentucky ... across fields of horse farms, and even to the racetrack.   I've taken it out into the wilderness to photograph elk. I had to keep closing it down and extending it out every time we got in and out of the vehicle, which was often. Also recently traveled all over Arizona with it to the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon De Chelley, etc. I was constantly opening and closing it, taking literally hundreds of photos (about 14 rolls) with no problems at all.

I also purchased the BG-E2 Battery Grip and the E1 Hand Grip thinking those would be enough to help steady the camera enough with this L lens on the front.  I was wrong.  I still love my hand grip for security reasons with my other lenses, and my battery grip I can't say enough about.  This monopod, however, is the ABSOLUTE BEST.  My shots have improved to the point where I have literally no blurry pictures at all.  I have shot well over 5,000 frames using this monopod and I have only had maybe 10 shots that were blurry. I attach the monopod to the ring mount on the lens and just start firing away with absolute confidence that my shots are going to be perfect.  And they are.  The monopod can handle the weight in the horizontal mode just fine.  The vertical mode is a bit weak with the support, but it's not that big of a deal. I stand 6'4"" tall and the monopod is the perfect shooting height for me.  I don't have to bend over at all to look through the eye-piece on the camera.

I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo: -I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! -The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly. Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30."

Unfortunately, after just 3 uses, the bottom lever just snapped off with hardly any pressure.  The plastic is too brittle to support the pressure of holding the leg in place.  Other users have noted this defect as well.  I can't see any way to repair this.  Adorama's return policy requires you to return defective products within 14 days, with complete packaging intact.

I have attached a carabiner to the monopod so I can hang it from a belt loop in my pants when I need my hands free for shooting.  I also use it when I am shooting sporting events from the sidelines.  The articulated head is very handy because it allows me to follow the action with the camera without having to move the monopod as the action gets closer to me.

This monopod, combined with the image stabilizer in my camera allows me to take some nice close-ups of birds with minimum hassle and without the extra weight and bother of a tripod. The results are not quite as sharp those I get with my tripod but are mostly quite good enough. They are noticeably crisper than hand held. Combined with a quick release attachment for my camera it also doubles as walking stick, which is very handy when negotiating slippery stream beds.The pan head seems a bit fragile being made of plastic but seems to hold my less than 2 pound camera/lens combination quite well and it rotates smoothly. I don't know how durable it is but so far so good. The monopod also strikes a nice balance between weight and stability. I'm satisfied 1 Year Update: The ball head is getting a little loose and requires quite a bit of torque to keep the camera level. This is using an ultra-zoom.  For landscape mode it's still fine but turning the camera on its side for portrait view shots it tends to flop. I do use it often but am looking to buying a metal head model especially now that I'm transitioning to a DSLR with a hefty zoom. The ball head on this is not robust enough to handle a two plus pound camera, though I don't imaging that this monopod was ever intended for that use."

I've always used a tripod for my larger lenses, but needed a monopod for taking pics at a golf event.  I used it attached to the collar ring on my Canon 70-200mm and found it easy to use and stable.   If I needed a monopod for something as large as a 400mm or 600mm, I would recommend something heavier than the Canon 100, but for my use it was very good."

It works nicely, and as others have mentioned, it seems sturdy enough to use as a walking stick -- although you would NOT, of course ever want to keep the camera attached if you're using the monopod as a walking stick! It extends above the eye level of my humble 5ft 9in frame, and really reduces camera shake and blur, suitable enough for the 35x zoom on my video camera, and all the more so for the modest zoom on my point and shoot camera. It beats lugging around a tripod. Great buy. *Follow-up It can't be killed. I have tortured this monopod, dragged it through swamps, smacked it on rocks, stuck it in mud, and threatened a nasty dog.

In retrospect, I wish I would have bought it as soon as I got my first SLR. Right off the bat, this monopod is incredibly light, and extends long enough for just about any application. It also collapses small enough to strap to the side of the with minimal overhang. I've already used it several times with a and , and it's excellent. Now I'm happily using the faster, deeper lens instead of my tried-and-true (albeit slower and shallower) . For those more familiar with tripods, monopods take some getting used to. If you're not willing to ""actively"" take shots or expect the monopod to magically raise and lower, you don't want one of these. But for what this costs, and how well it's made, you can't really go wrong giving it a shot. This is probably the least expensive thing I carry with the rest of my gear (next to a lens cloth), and next to the XSi body, it easily gets the most use."
600656,A3VMNLJNDP5GJU,0,1,96,B0002YE6EU,6/29/2008,5,6,6,"Light, cheap, solid","One of the rules of photography is that for any serious work, you're going to be on a tripod.  Tripods aren't possible in a lot of situations either by needing to be mobile or being in a busy environment and not wanting to be a trip hazard.  A monopod gives you most of the stability of a tripod when you can't use one.  Try using one in a darkened aquarium. I did my first wedding shoot using only non-IS lenses with this monopod and had very few tossers due to blur.  Yet I was still mobile enough to shoot a wedding.  I know how steady my hands are, and a similar keeper ratio simply would not have been possible without it. It's also solid enough to use as a walking cane or possibly for self-defense.  It collapses short enough to not be a burden to haul around in my equipment bag, meaning that it goes where my camera goes.   Absolutely worth the money."

I saw others using them and it seemed just the ticket for quick, steady shooting.  I have a Canon EOS MArk II N with a 100-400mm zoom lens.  So when I got back from my trip I searched online and found this Canon monopod.  A couple of weeks after I received it I had the chance to try it out at a surf contest (O'Neill Cold Water Classic).  It was just the thing for action shooting stability and so much easier than using a regular tripod.  I took over 1500 pictures over 5 days and got the most perfect exposures I've ever taken.  I'd recommend this monopod to any level photographer.  I'm an amature.  Cheers!"

I do not have the cash available to purchase Image Stabilised lenses and was a bit disappointed in the sharpness of my shots.  I shoot mostly outdoors and rarely use a tripod.  The price of the monopod was what initially appealed to me.  For $40.00 delivered it was a no brainer.  I looked at other monopods and debated whether or not I needed the ball head...Anyway, I received the monopod, hooked it to my Canon 350D and started shooting.  My shots are sharper!  The product is well made and I feel very good about its value.  A tip for newbies like me, when not extended, hold it in your hand with the camera agianst your shoulder and your lens over your shoulder.  The ball head is a nice feature and so is the rubber tip at the bottom.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did."

For someone who's just starting out, I didn't want to spend a fortune for this piece of equipment and saw that this model had some great reviews.  I agree with all of them.  The monopod is easy to attach and has a great mini ball head that works well.  I use a Canon 40D and the monopod adequately supports it.  Maybe someday I'll spend the money to buy a more expensive one but that's not going to be anytime soon. I have a feeling that this one will suit my needs just fine for some time to come."

The flip locks could not be easier or quicker to use.  I estimate a maximum of 5 seconds to completely elongate or collapse this monopod, after a little practice. - Excellent height range.  I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, and find that my camera is a little high, when the monopod is fully extended. - The ball joint has proven sturdy and easy to adjust, even flipping between 'portrait' and 'landscape' orientations. - Monopod weight is very light. Bad?: - The head where the camera rests is covered in what appears to be cork.  So far it has held up just fine, but I worry that it may eventually abrade away. I have had this monopod for several months and am delighted with it.  Even ignoring the low price, this has been my best recent purchase of photographic equipment. Why a monopod?  It provides much of the stability of a tripod without the cumbersome set-up time and almost none of the required footprint.  I have used this monpod while seated in a crowded middle school theater without disturbing other audience members, to great effect.  While no monopod can give 100% of the stability of a tripod, the reduction in movement can do wonders for one's photography, especially in low-light situations. One note on use: It is often recommended that one switch off image stabilization features when using a tripod.  My experience with leaving image stabilization on with the monopod has been very favorable."

I used this on my honeymoon all over Nashville and I've got to say, it's very sturdy and reliable. I didn't want to take my tripod with us because of all the traveling we were doing and the monopod small size collapsed made it very convenient. The other factor was it's length extended, I'm better then 6 feet tall and this is one of the few that would be tall enough for me and still have a great price."

It held my Canon S5 IS on both pavement, soft soil and grass with a shutter speed down to 2 seconds. All 100 of my pictures were sharp. This monopod collapses to a handy small size and is easy to carry. A quick release would have been nice, but I wouldn't expect that at such a low price. The ball was easy to adjust for camera vertical shots. This is a quality lightweight product that I would highly recommend to a friend."

So, I decided to invest in a Canon Monopod 100 where all I had to do was just raise or lower the one leg which I found was so much better than using a tripod. I'm not knocking tripods, because I do use a tripod for other photo shoots, and I'd surely be lost without one. But, in my case, shooting flowers, I simply found that a monopod worked wonders. And, when i first used the monopod, I was afraid that my shots would come out ""blurry"", but quite the opposite, no blur at all, so thats when I was sold on using a monopod."

In this case the price, performance, and  ease of use make this an extremely attractive option compared to its more expensive brethren.  This will accommodate heights of all sizes and travels well.  I don't expect it to hold up as well as a $300 monopod, but at this price I don't need it to.  It will hold up nicely for a long time though."

The light weight, small size when collapsed and miniballhead all combine to make a very useful addition to my  photo kit.  Although I have expensive Gitzo tripods & Canon DSLRs, I find this Canon monopod gets a lot of use.  I keep it in the car and often having it immediately available makes the difference in getting that unexpected photo.  Although the price is amazingly low, it is a high quality product, and attractive as well.   Highly recommend."

I am not a photography guy so maybe this is a nothing product, but I think its cool. Instead of the twist action poles you normally get, this has a latch that releases the pole so it can slide. So its a LOT faster than untwisting sliding and twisting again. Nice foam grip, and a ball joint to mount the camera then set it at an angle. I'm looking forward to using this. Very light also. It collapses to a little over a foot in length, good for a backpack. Hand strap just in case someone bumps the pole. The strap is at the top next to the camera so the camera will be saved. Buy it if you have the extra cash. My carpel tunnel is thanking me already."

I have a tendency to shoot a lot of tilted pictures, and my monopod eliminates that problem.  I find I use it almost entirely instead of my tripod (although I haven't tried it for those night shots... yet).  It's so easy to move around with, especially since I shoot a lot of youth sports.  It adjusts to every height I've needed it at, and it never slips once it's tightened.  The ball head can be made as tight, or as loose, as you want it.  Plus, it looks impressive!

It easy to set up,just a second or two, at the hight that you need to get a good shot at the birds. It can be used like a handle too for more stable shooting.  I bird with my slr in that I take photos to make my identifications of the various species.

Cameras, lenses, computers, cables, books, magazines, and that's before you get to the essentials like clothing. Hardly room to add a bulky tripod. I needed the support when holding long lenses or shooting in low light an my images suffered because of it. Enter the Canon Monopod 100! I never leave home without it now, even toss in my car for local trips. It's improved my low-light shot and has been great for steadying my telephoto work. It's light weight, yet strong, with an easy to use swivel head. Makes a good walking stick on hikes too. Me and my Canon Monopod 100 make for a great tripod!"

The quick-release locks on the leg allow for easy extension and retraction.  The pan head is an added convenience some other low-end pods do not have.  I will be using it with my 12X zoom with 1.5X tele-converter for added stability.  Although I have not yet taken the trip for which I purchased it, I expect it to serve me well when the time arrives."

Though you have to be cautious with the camera plus lens weight- especially if you want to put a 300 mm lens on that. The ballhead wont take the load of them together and bents down. For a normal zoom lens, its slick."

I needed something to hold my super zoom Panasonic FZ28.  I shoot pictures and video at my kids sports events (football, soccer, field hockey).  Many pictures I was taking at full zoom were blurry.  Now, with the help of the Canon monopole, my pictures at full zoom are in focus, and video is much more stable.  Couldn't be happier.  Highly Recommend this product."

I considered the Manfrotto models, but when I compared the features, this Canon model seemed to come out on top, or at least for my needs. I'm a casual photographer that will use this mostly to take pictures of my kids and other family photos.  This monopod is small enought that it's very easy to bring along, or just keep in the car in the event I'll need it.  Although the camera that I have has image stability capability, I can still tell when my hand is too shakey.  Using the monopod has nearly eliminated any bluriness due to camera shake. The Canon monopod is fairly easy to use with one hand.  For instance, you can loosen the mount bracket and screw it to the camera, all with one hand, while the other hand is holding the camera.  The pressure brackets that keep the legs from moving are very taught and won't come undone accidentally.  The bottom of the monopod is rubber, so it doesn't slip when used on smooth surfaces, such as wood floors, or glass tables.  It's also important to note that it won't scuff up and sensitive surfaces. Overall, I'm very happy with the Canon Monopod.  The value and features really put it on top and has proven to be exactly what I was looking for."

I didn't know something like this existed.  I brought it with me to Hawaii (march 2009).  I had fun using it.  It was very handy in taking pictures of myself.  Rather than disturb other people to take a picture of me, I just put my Canon Sx10IS on it (tilt the lcd view finder of my camera and put it on a 10 second timer) extend the monopod and I get beautiful shots without having the camera too close to my face.

It's not the strongest piece of equipment but It does well with my Evolt E 500. I have not used it very long so it may disappoint me still. I will update this review if there are any major flaws. One problem I do have is that there is no quick release plate. This makes a problem with screwing and unscrewing your camera from the monopod. The threads of the camera screw can ware out creating an expensive problem. A separate attachment can probably be bought.

Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile."

Don't get me wrong, the ""tulip"" shade works fine (although it throws a shadow on imges when you use the pop-up flash), but it should cost a fraction of what they charge. I'd guess they cost less than two bucks to make, if that. It's nothing but formed plastic. I don't like giving Canon a bad review because, otherwise, they make world-class products. So I'd give this lens shade five stars for use, but one star for pricing, an overall 3."

Back in ""the day"" when shooting 35mm film I could barely afford the cost of processing - let alone what I thought were fancy accessories.  Well - some reading and a trip to Alaska with my Canon Digital Rebel XT - I learned, and appreciate, the importance of a lens hood.  I bought a rubber lens hood (not lens specific) at a local camera store that was totally unacceptable - then bought the lens hood for my Canon lens from Amazon.  It works great - no flare - no vignetting - and it makes the lens look pretty cool too! I would suggest having a hood for all your lenses and never shooting without - along with the obvious - it saves the front of the lens from bumping damage which is important with longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting on a photo excursion boat full of other people all jockeying for a shot!  Amazon service and prices - as usual - were fantastic and although I HATE to wait for things - I am usually happy I do when I order from here.  Happy snapping!!!"

Canon charges a lot for its original hood and I definitely think that it should be supplied with the lens! Acting like this, Canon is just playing too much tight. However, I confess that the Canon original lens hood for the 17-85mm lens is of far highest quality than the one from Precision design that I bought. I regret to have bought this third party hood.

This case will only marginally protect your camera from rain; there are openings on each side where water can get in.  If you want water proof protection this case will not do it, nor was it ever intended to. Any lens longer (dimensionally) than a 17-85 will not fit. It's expensive, but so is my 30D.  This will provide the added protection I need while traveling. The part of the case that fits on the camera body must be removed for battery and CF change (so not that often given battery is good for 500+ pictures and a 2 GB CF is good for 500 pictures at maximum jpeg); otherwise removal isn't necessary for any other reason. Removal is via one screw.   The near flush screw is difficult to grip and turn although it does have a slot where a U.S. Quarter will fit....in my opinion the screw could have been designed better.

Yes, I had an issue where I lost a partition, but I became well aware of the program after that. Bought Version 9 (even after reading the reviews) because I bought a Dell laptop and for some reason Dell thinks I like a 80 GB drive all in one partition.  Thinking I had nothing to lose since the laptop is so new, I bought Partition Commander 9 and installed it.  I too chose NOT to use the 2 floppies, and install continued fine for me.  I chose NOT to install or use System Commander because I didn't want to have that as a boot loader. For the single purpose of breaking my one drive into 3, I rebooted the laptop and went to work in the familiar interface that I was used to in Version 6.  After making the changes, exited out, rebooted and expected the worst due to the previous reviews here.  XP booted with no issues and I now have 3 partitions. This is one program that one needs to get to know first before doing anything.  Just like any other partitioning program, one mistake can cost alot. For me, I'm quite happy with my choice. It was $20 after rebates and it did just what I wanted it to do."

The initial installation of the basic program was accomplished flawlessly with the setup wizard. The problem arose when I tried to use the automatic ""add another OS"" feature. The partitioning would seemingly progress fine for several minutes, but then I would get a message that the program encountered ""an error,"" and it would stop. I uninstalled and reinstalled the program without difficulty, but with the same result (except the error message popped up at different times) for a total of four attempts at ""add another OS."" Incidentally, I chose to not make the boot disks, as this is a new computer with nothing important on it yet, so I could more easily restore it than rebuild it. So, I then decided to create the new partition manually. I am closer to ""novice"" than ""experienced,"" and I did have a few false starts. However, it did come with a well-written printed manual, and I did not have too much difficulty figuring out what to do. Everything then worked out fine, and thus far I have had no problems running either operating system."

Uninstalling Partition Commander 9 did NOT revert my system to its original state. On rebooting, I see the ""NTLDR is missing"" error message. (I use Win XP Pro) This was getting very serious. FIXBOOT and FIXMBR commands from WinXP recovery console ran without complaint but the NTLDR missing problem remained. I copied NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM from my winxp CD to the C: too.

I have not used the multiple OS BOOT tools, and I have not used Recovery Commander, so you need to look elsewhere for reports on those. What I have used extensively are the tools for splitting disks into several partitions, changing filing systems from FAT to NTFS, resizing partitions, changing cluster sizes, moving data onto new disks and recovering data from disks that have crashed.  I am currently using PC9, and it does all that the manual says it will do.  It may be that those who have had bad experiences with this have not read the manual before diving in.  Any tool that reads and writes directly to the surface of the disk can be dangerous. My experience has been uniformly positive.  The most recent correspondence with technical support came when the power failed while I was enlarging a partition, and the machine would not boot when it came on again.  Technical support were prompt and patient with email advice.  Although the correspondence stretched over several days because I was working in a very different time zone, I do not think that any of their responses took more then 3-4 working hours.  They first got me back into Windows, had me run a diagnostic programme, then had me change values directly on the disk.  Despite having had the power go off mid operation, I suddenly had an entire partition reappear, complete with 11,328 files in 800+ folders.

The program loaded anyway, and things were fine till I shutdown and went to restart the next day. I got a blank black screen. I could only boot from the CD.

I have burn over 30 DVDs since August 2004 for backing up files, making home movies and there haven't been any problems yet. The software that comes with this burner is for Mac and PC.  I use the PC's software, which include Roxio's Easy Media 7.0; that can burn movie, CD and DVD, and do some simple editing.  Converting a file to a video on a slow laptop is kind of long though.  There is a DVD player software included also, but there are a dime a dozen out there.  I burned at 16X, 8X, 4X speed on DVD-R and DVD+R on Sony, Verbatim, Memorex, Fuji, TDK media and they all work fine.  This drive is one of the faster external DVD-r options available.  I have yet to use the expensive Double Layer DVD media option. The drive has a nice metallic silver exterior that is very robust and sturdy, with a blue ON/OFF button, connection to a firewire or USB2 output. I have a Dell 8200 PIV laptop with 1gigs of ram, with an 80gigs external firewire hard-drive that connect straight to the external D2 burner.  It is somewhat smooth and quiet NEC's drive.

It's hooked up to a laptop in my house that functions as a file server, so the only purpose of that laptop is to accept the files and give me the capability to burn them to the DVD. The drive is a gamble to say the least. It seemed to work well with Sony DVD-R blanks, very few corruptions or errors during the process, but then after I tried Sony DVD+R and bought a whole bundle of Office Depot DVD+R blanks, things got worse. The Roxio software would complain about ""Not a valid recordable media"" in the drive, even though it was a virgin clean blank from the pack, the exact same pack that just had a workable disk yesterday. Sometimes I would get the ""Unspecified error 0x01"" roughly 3 hours during the burn process, which is extremely annoying (forgot to mention I hooked it to USB 1.1 port, so it doesn't function at 16x, but that's my fault). Other times it would be another ""Transcoding error"" and ""Unspecified error"" with trashed blanks. I'd say I get about 30-35 successful burns with this drive on a 50-disk DVD+R pack. The rest of the blanks have to go in the garbage. Lately I've installed Nero over Roxio software with its ""useful"" error messages and things seem to run smoother.

I have burned data DVDs on a Pentium 4 PC WinXP through USB2 port and it works just fine, though not as fast as with FireWire.  I have even used it to burn data DVDs through USB 1.1 port on my iBook G3 and it worked, though it took much longer, for obvious reasons.  I haven't tried burning Dual-Layer yet.

In all instances, it consistently fails to burn dual-layer DVDs without incuring fatal write errors. When burning standard DVDs, the failure rate is about 25 percent. Returning the DVD burner to LaCie for warranty repairs did no good. It still does not work, so I'm sending it back a second time. Maybe I bought a lemon.

I would say it is almost class-action-lawsuit bad in terms of how much time and grief it will cause users.  The following are my experiences with it, and I consider myself to be an expert in software installation and maintenance.  Maybe I just got unlucky because of particular features of my system, but I doubt it -- I suspect the software just blows. First, installation was buggy and took many hours between the huge 700+ MB software and the fact that installation consisted of:  try install, hang your computer, try unstall, hang your computer, repeat. Second, if you don't have your computer behind a firewall, you are probably doomed.  It takes only a few seconds hooked up to the Internet without a firewall for your computer to get infected with viruses.  The HP Photosmart software SHUTS OFF YOUR WINDOWS FIREWALL AS IT STARTS UP, leaves the firewall down for a bit while it poops around, and only then starts back up your firewall.  Unbelievable! Third, the HP software causes problems with other software.  HP software starts up sessions that drop me out of full-screen games, for example.  This has happened to me at many critical times in on-line flight simulators, for example, causing me to crash -- after a long time of setup. Fourth, if I don't have the printer turned on, booting up my computer takes about 10 times as long.  Now I get to leave the printer on always. Fifth, uninstall doesn't work.  Don't like this crappy software having its inept claws into your operating system, making it slow and unreliable?  Too bad.  If I uninstall, I find that all kinds of HP crapware didn't get uninstalled and still starts up every time I reboot my computer. HP makes great hardware . . . and some of the world's worst software.  I knew this before trying this product but figured, ""Hey, it's been years since I last tried HP products (and was screwed by their crappy software).  Maybe they turned it around by now.""  Nope.  This is bad enough that I probably won't buy HP computer products ever again, no matter how appealling they seem at a hardware level.  I have to remind myself of this (and past) software horrors."

I knew HP had lousy software the last time I tried using an HP inkjet printer back in 2000.  Back then, HP tech support tried asking for so much free GDI memory that only a clean machine with no installed software could achieve those levels.  But hope springs eternal, and I thought that 5 years would be enough for HP to hire some decent programmers.  Unfortunately, that was not the case. I wanted to have this printer to replace an aging scanner and be able to print out quality photos.  Shouldn't be an issue in this day and age.  Although I didn't scan much (enough to send a fax), the quality seemed pretty good for a multi-purpose device...better than I expected.  I did print out a number of photos, and they did turn out first rate. However, the initial innocent error regarding ""volume"" got worse in just a few days.  Rebooting the computer resulted in ""Windows could not load the installer for Volume"".  Soon Microsoft Automatic Updates started failing 10 to 20 times upon each reboot, and by the 3rd day Win32 services were having problems.  Thinking that I had a virus despite plenty of firewall and anti-virus protection, I spent the better part of 2 days trying to isolate what was going wrong.  Eventually I uninstalled the HP software (you have to download special software from their site and run it 4 times in a row to clean everything off).  And that still wasn't enough...I had to reinstall windows.  And I have a standard Dell PC; I shudder to think if I had a custom PC. So, before installing HP drivers, my computer was fine.  While the HP drivers were installed, 3 significant software failures occurred.  Fully removing the HP drivers results in the computer operating fine again.

I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this....HP you need to figure out how computers work b/c mine is a basic Dell.  I am not sure that I'll ever buy HP again b/c of the software."

It seemed like if I plugged the 2610 into our Linksys wireless router, I would be able to use my iBook with air port to print.  And it worked!!!  I will admit it took a long time for my iBook to ""find"" the printer over the wireless network --I even called the help line--but while I was on the help line, the computer found the printer.  So now I can be anywhere in the house and print from my laptop.  Also, the scanner works wirelessly too. Next we installed the software on the PC.  We were worried because it seemed like Mac users had fewer complaints about the software than PC users.  Well everything works fine on the PC, too! And a note about their customer support--I called during the weekend and got a live person immediately, who was American (some people complain about their calls being routed to India), and extremely helpful. A+ So far this printer is great and I can't wait to get rid of our fax, scanner, ink jet printer and laser printer!"

The software setup on my home network (XP Home SP2/Netgear Wireless) was OK.  The setup software does take a long time to run, but generally everything went well, with one exception.  When booting the PC I get a message about ""Data Execution Prevention on Generic Host"".  I emailed HP customer support, and within an hour they replied that this is a known issue with SP2 and they're working on a driver update.  They suggested a temporary workaround.  I subscribed to the email list to be notified when the new drivers are available. All said and done.... I'm pretty darn happy with my new HP.

We have a small but complex network here at Rational Recovery Systems, Inc., and I got the Murphy's Law jitters reading so many reports of cyber-horror, complete with outsourced tech-support from the Far, Far East. I did a Google search on HP's software minefield on this product, and I noticed that there were no complaints from Mac users. I held my breath and took the plunge. Perfect! If you are a Mac user, have no fear of being held hostage by your own computer and Asian geeks. The software loaded in 20 minutes, not too bad, and in the three-click setup mode it automatically discovered all of the correct IP'S, and printed the first time perfectly, and almost in silence! I know the PC/Mac debate is a sensitive thing, not PC to even discuss lately (ahem), but folks, the MS Emperor has no clothes. In practically every installation manual or instruction sheet for hardware and software, the instructions on PC installation goes on for page after page, using strange symbols and arcane language I don't even want to learn, and then, on the last page is, ""For Mac installation, insert CD and push `Install.' Enjoy."" PC owners beware. Unless you are lucky on the day of installation, you may regret purchasing the Photosmart 2610, not to mention regretting owning a PC. According to an astonishing number of PC owners, your machine may be ruined, your network cracked, and you may spend weeks plumbing the depths of PC lore to salvage what remains. If you're Mac with OS X 10.3 or later, enjoy one of the finest all-in-one printers on the market today. The OCR function is superior to any previous document scanning software we've had, and we've tried a lot of OCR scanning setups. The panel controls are intuitive, user-friendly, and the color output rivals (does not equal) laser color printing. It's so quiet; we just hear little clicks that says it's busy printing. It allows copying in either color or b/w to avoid overusing supplies. I didn't intend for it to replace our fax machine, but seeing its other services, it probably won't be long before we put it online and retire another very adequate fax machine."

We had too much stuff - scanner, printer, slide scanner, external drives - you name it.  And now we needed a fax.  Rather than try to find a place to stuff it, we opted to get an all-in one.  But there was a problem: I didn't want to put up with a loss of color printing quality or scanning quality.  Also, my wife wanted a printer with digital memory input slots.  From my previous shopping, I immediately thought of HP.  We went to an appliance store to shop, because I needed to see the printing and scanning results to be satisfied.  The 2610 printed and scanned very well, and was faster than the competition.  It is easy to use - very intuitive.  The install is a bit slow, but once you're up and running, it's a breeze."
600463,A1V981XARKIMNT,0,1,76,B0002YH8AY,9/12/2006,1,10,10,The worst printer I've ever owned.,"Do not purchase this printer! I have only owned this printer for a year, and here is a list of the problems I have had with it in this short time: 1. I never could get it to work right on a wireless network. Typically, I could eventually get my laptop to connect to it wirelessly, but it usually took multiple rebootings of my laptop and resettings of the printer before this would happen. I finally just connected it to our main computer by a USB cable and e-mailed anything on my laptop that I needed to print so that I could access it from the main computer. It turns out that this is faster than it taking 20 minutes or so just to connect to the printer. 2. Installing the software was a long and difficult process. I had to uninstall and reinstall several times, and had to download multiple updates before it would work properly. Furthermore, the software slows down the boot time of my computer significantly. 3. At first, the printer was very fast at printing pages. After about a month, however, it began to slow down occasionally. Often during a single print job it would print out a page or two VERY SLOWLY, but print out the rest of the pages at normal speed. And when I say very slowly, I mean at least two minutes for a single page of text only! Over time, this sporadic slowdown occurred more and more frequently, until now it is the rule, and a rapidly printed page is the exception. 4. Inexplicably, the last time we changed printer cartridges, it failed to recognize the black ink cartridge. These were the official HP cartridges, mind you. So we tried a different cartridge (still an official one), and this one wasn't recognized either. We contacted the company and they said power surges could cause the problem, though we had not had any recent storms. We were one month past the end of our one year warranty, so our only option now is to buy a new printer. They offered to sell us a later model at a discount, but I declined, as I'm not sure I'll ever buy another HP product again. In short, the HP Photosmart 2610 All-in-One is the most unreliable and troublesome printer I've ever owned. Avoid it like the plague."

I received an Epson photosmart portable printer for Christmas which produced outstanding picture quality but was NOT user friendly at all (no LCD screen to view/edit photos). At the same time my printer died so I decided to go with an all-in-one unit to do some home-based business as well.  I purchased the HP 2610, installed it today (single windows-based PC - took about an hour) and it's working great! I was very concerned about the installation because of some of the other reviews but I had no glitches whatsoever.  I have been able to fax, copy, print and edit/print photos with no issues!  The photo editing software has all the standard features including cropping, red eye reduction and ability to add effects like sepia, etc.  The software is alo pretty easy to use as is the entire unit.  I have not read ANY of the instruction manual yet (only the set-up pamphlet) and was able to perform all of the functions on this unit.  That's impressive because I'm a medical person...not a computer person!  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that, compared with the little portable Epson printer, the digital picture quality is a little grainy and not the best I've seen.  But, will definitely do for an amateur.  Also, the printer in general seems a little louder than some others I've heard on display in stores, but still better than my old deskjet that died.  I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it highly for an all-in-one unit!!!"

I am by no means a computer expert, but was able to set up this printer on a wireless network on my first try (running Windows XP, connected via a wireless Linksys router).   Faxing comes through beautifully, and the print speed at this price point is astonishing.  Print quality even at the most rudimentary level is almost laser quality.  Haven't tried photoprinting yet, but if it is even close to the quality I get for Eckherd's photo processing I will consider this printer a steal. By the way, if you own a wireless router, don't waste your money on the HP 2710.  The 2610 has built-in networking, and your router will act as the hub for printing from multiple wireless PCs.  This feature in addition to photoprinting, faxing, copying, scanning for under $300 is quite remarkable. Would be nice if there was a document feeder for high volume faxing/copying, but unless this feature is high on your priority list, this printer is just about perfect."

I was a bit surprised HP would release the s/w with a major bug that slowed everything down, but HP's posted patch (which currently isn't included in their updates) resolves the problem. One thing I discovered which is nice is that when you hook up the unit to a phone line, you can fax right from any system (e.g. wireless) on the network much the same as if that system is connected to a modem."

This is my first all-in-one, and I have never had the ability to frax, scan or copy before and I can't imagine going back to just a printer again.  All of these functions work either as I expected or usually better than I expected.  For instance, when scanning from the printer I can pick which PC it goes to, I do not have to be at the PC to control the scan.  Fax works great with my answering machine.  Chose copies in color or B&W.  The display is simple to read and navigate. What I did not like was the software install.  I configured the printer to connect directly to my network router.  You cannot set a static IP, this may cause some incontinence for some, not a problem with my router though. I installed the software on both my desktop and my laptop.  Everything seemed to work fine.  The next day I went to work and my laptop worked very poorly.  After doing some troubleshooting I found that one of the HP proces was looking for the network printer IP every minute or so, and would have to wait on a timeout.  These delays made the laptop unusable.  Finally uninstalled the HP software and everything worked fine again. I was able to get an update to the software that fixed this problem but it did not come with the initial update which I found strange.  .  A USB install is probably fine, I am glad I did not have to go this route though.  The install reminded me of installing Office, it is a lot of software.  The software itself seems mediocre to me, certainly nothing I can live without except the OCR which is basically functional.  I personally did not like software that tries to make albums of every scan/photo you put on the hard disk.  The software is functional and works, but no WOW factor or feeling that you got something great. Overall though I got what I wanted and a bit more in the hardware, it even makes up for the software that came with it."

First, when we got the printer and tried to register it, the HP registration page was set up so that you can't adjust the page window size and get to the end of the registration form.  Next, when we installed the software, we immediately started having system errors on our computer every time we turned our computer on.  Eventually HP updated their software to include a patch, but it took 2 months before we got this resolved.  Then the printer started having print cartridge errors.  The print quality was poor, with colors being used when we specify black, and the ink smearing and printing unevenly. We verified that the cartridges were not out of ink and we have cleaned the cartridges.  Our computer gave us a print error message and told us to check the HP printer status box to find out what is wrong.  All the status box told us was that our ""printer is connected.""    We have gone through all the trouble shooting we can think of, and ended up needing to call HP directly because their online services wouldn't connect and we got another error message.  (We weren't experiencing any trouble with our internet connection.)  We were sent to 2 wrong departments at HP before getting through to technical support. After about 2 hours on the phone with tech support, we could not figure out was was wrong.  We had removed the print cartridge as part of our troubleshooting, and when we tried to put it back in, the printer shrieked and started smoking.  HP decided to replace our printer. We received our replacement printer very quickly.  But again the software comes with errors and we had to spend extra time downloading patches and uninstalling and reinstalling the software to stop getting error messages.  The printer frequently experiences errors during printing, which causes the software to freeze up.  We can't cancel the print job or try again without re-booting the system.  The only good thing I can say is that the print quality is excellent. 5 months later, we got an unknown ""scanning error"" while trying to copy a document, and after talking to HP, they are sending us ANOTHER replacement printer!!  We have had this printer less than a year and are on our second replacement. We have never had so many problems with a product in such a short amount of time.

The fax function requires that you scan the pages one at a time which would be time consuming if you need to fax more than a few pages.  My biggest complaint is that when I had a minor problem with the printer and I called customer service, I was told that since my warranty was expired, they would charge me $60-$80 JUST TALK TO TECH SUPPORT!  Then they suggested that I might as well just buy a new printer from them for $99!!!  I'm not sure how that was supposed to help me send the fax that I needed to transmit that day!

I'd give it zero stars actually to match it's performance. The printer can do both network and USB, but not at the same time.  By ""default"" they ship with a network cable included, and ""no"" USB cable.  So I guess they would push this item to be networked.  Well ok, that's why we're looking at it, right?  The hardware specs are quite impressive.  When you get to fiddle with that color LCD screen, menus, and set options directly on the printer which remain stored during power off, it's nice.  The auto-aligning printer cartridges is phenomenol.  But that's all I know about the hardware, because the software simply will not work properly for multi-users.  More on that later. The CD has old software (v4.2.0), so I opted for the newer software on the web (v4.7.0).  Usually the idea with software development is that a new release is made when bugs have been discovered and fixed.  But let's take a moment to look at the download and install sizes.  472MB ""full"" download?  Are you crazy?  For a printer/scanner driver?  75MB ""basic"" download, it's still massive.  But don't forget, the ""basic"" install is about 160MB!  Imagine what the 472MB install requires!  I simply haven't got the disc space for that at the moment.  :-\  So I went with the basic installer. Ok, so what is my problem with the software?  Well, it's pushed as a network printer, so you'd expect certain things to work.  Networks.  How many times have you bothered to install a network for one single user?  Usually a network implies that multiple people might be using the network.  Perhaps from any number of computers.  So I didn't see a network installer, which would have been nice.  But that's the least of my problems at this point. Usually in a multi-user environment, there are ""Administrators"" and ""Users"".  Users are much more frequently logged in, and are the most likely to hit nasty web sites or download virus infected software or emails.  So, it is understood in the networked environment, that the distinction and boundaries between users and administrators is necessary. So why then does this printer driver work only for an Administrator?  That's right.  Print as a user, you get ""Error - Printing"".  Well, which is it?  Is it an error, or is it printing?  If it's an error, you'd think they'd actually describe the error somewhere.  I looked through each and every tab and panel this software provides, and I find nothing but the most trivial of configurables.  The only non-trivial options are related to ""port configuration"", which is still extremely limited. Furthermore, the failed print job will sit in queue forever.  Regardless of the configurable settings that imply that things can go out of order, any subsequent print jobs from the Administrator will not print until the failed job is manually cleared.  What garbage. I tried contacting HP web support, and spent about 3 hours in total.  I got nowhere.  They have no idea.  They seemed to think it was a ""permissions"" problem. For the first 2 hours I performed each and every step.  I am very familiar with the target OS, Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 2, all windows updates applied.  I'm familiar with the ""Security"" tabs and dialogues (a.k.a. access control lists).  I twiddled filesystem, print driver, and registry permissions as directed.  They suggested deleting an account and recreating.  That solved nothing and has just created several hours more work to restore the account.  I should have created a dummy test account, but that is my fault.  Just you be sure to learn from my lesson and remember to do it.  ;-)  Finally, I got disconnected from their chat while performing a step. Then I star a new web chat.  And I explain what happened.  It takes the new tech about 45 minutes to read through the transcript which was readily available.  Now, it should only have taken 5 minutes to read.  I'm a slow reader, slightly dyslexic, with reading comprehension difficulties.  So I could excuse perhaps 10 minutes reading, no more.  45 minutes, and I am thinking that English is perhaps not even their native language, or they are functionally braindead, or less versed with computers than I.  After an hour, I am given a URL to an ""Access Denied"" utility.  I read the page, and it describes a problem where an ""Access Denied"" message pops up when installing the software.  I explained that this is not the problem I am experiencing.  They said well, it's probably all related, so just try it.  And after that, it's suggested I check Microsoft's web site. Now, ok, I'm frustrated at this point, but I'm still hanging in there.  This software required the old software to be uninstalled, reboot, the Access Denied patch to be run, reboot, then re-install the ""basic"" (v4.7.0) drivers, then reboot.  By this time it's in the wee hours of the morning, so I retire. A couple days later, my patience has returned, so I attempt this process.  I use the App Wizard (appwiz.msc), a.k.a. the ""Add/Remove Programs"" control panel dialog.  I uninstall the one and only entry that has anything to do with HP, printers, scanners, or anything.  There's only one, so I uninstall it.  I even rebooted.  Great.  But, err, the registry still has all these dead entries.  There's still all the DLLs in the WINDOWS\System32 directory.  There's still a service installed and running.  There's HP stuff all over the place.  That's not exactly what I call an uninstall. So I head over to the HP web site again, locate the download page for my printer, and find an ""Uninstall Utility"" (v4.2.1), which I noticed will ""Only uninstall v4.2.0 software"".  There is no way to uninstall v4.7.0 software.  There are known bugs in the functionality of the v4.2.0 software, so it'd not only be preferable to use v4.7.0 (you'd think), it's probably required.  And yes there's patches that came out after v4.7.0 as well.  Whether or not they apply only to v4.2.0 or v4.7.0 is anybody's guess, as it's not documented anywhere. Anyways, enough is enough, I ran your damn patch already, which probably didn't even address the specific problem in the first place.  (Getting testy at this point.)  ;-)  So I run the re-install.  Same exact behavior.  Administrator can print.  Users can not.  If I make the user a member of the Administrators group, the user can print, but they're now an Administrator.  If they got one of those malicious pieces of code (worms, viruses, spyware), they can do a lot more damage.  Making all users into administrators is not a solution, it's not even a workaround.  You may as well leave your keys in your car, your car running, and put a sign on your car that says ""I left my keys in my car and my car running, but please don't steal it.""  A fat lot of good this all did for me. So, I head over to Microsoft's site.  I start looking for more information about what is going on here.  I look at the System Event Notifications.  I find an error message like this: Date: [date] Time: [time] Type: Error User: [HOSTNAME\username] Computer: [HOSTNAME] Source: Print Category: None Event ID: 6161 Description: The document [application] owned by [username] failed to print on printer HP Photosmart 2600 series.

I installed on the house main computer and my laptop any other computer can connect through the main.  Everything functioned fine at the house.  I was pretty happy. The next day my laptop would not function at work.  I pretty quickly found it was trying to establish a connection to the printer and would hang the computer until it would time out.  Less than a minute later it would do it all over again.  I had to uninstall all of the software to be able to work.  I called them after work and was told to get an update online.  I wonder why it did not do an update after installation.  Now it gets regular updates.  At one point my laptop lost the ability to communicate with the printer for over a week.  I set up print sharing through the desktop and was almost going to do a full un/install cycle.  But tried to do a scan before doing that and not only did the scan work but printing worked after.  Now for the last 6 months everything has been stable. On a whole the software is bloated and does not have a very intuitive interface.  With all the software they provide I still have not found a very good picture/photo editor and have found a good freeware one to do this.  Scanning software is pretty average and like every other photo organizer tries to force you into a photo album organization that does not work well with other software. Where this unit shines for me is the printer interface itself.  Being able to copy, fax and yes scan from the printer is very handy.  If you have the HP software running on a PC you can select which PC to scan from.  Faxing and copying is a snap, select color or b"

I am certainly no expert on electronics and I am using this for my home office.  I do not use it for business... only for volunteer organizations that I am in.  I was skeptical of this printer because of the reviews I had read.  I had absolutely no problem with the installation (which is unusual in my case!) and it works beautifully.  The print quality is great and I love the HP Photo Share that comes with it.  I am not trying to put it on a network, only using a USB cable.  This printer replaced an older HP all-in-one printer that was fine but slow.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the all-in-one features."
600448,A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1,0,1,61,B0002YH8AY,3/21/2007,3,6,6,Not bad for light home use,"HP classifies this as a home/small business all in one.  It is decent at doing most light jobs. It scans nicely and the quality of the color/black and white output is commendable. A great feature is the menory ports.  Simply insert memory card, memory stick, or whatever and it works (at least with my Mac). It also has a USB port on the front which is nice to  hookup addition USB devices to it. The problem I have is that for heavier jobs it doens't cut it. Faxing long documents is tedious.  You have to manually put each single page on the flat bed, push a button, wait for it to scan, and so on.  And if you have a small business like I do, that is out of the question. Also, as someone previously said, paper handling is a major concern.  It is not a printer you can set to print a 30 page document and then walk away from. It is prone to either grabbing 5 sheets at once, or jamming alltogether. If you are going to use this for home use.  Printing occasional documents or photos, scanning photos or documents, great. But if you plan to use this for heavier business apps, I would go for a more rubust All In One."

This printer has done the job well.  Great quality, quick printing, many options, scans well, and even the fax machine has come in handy. The only complaints I have is with the software HP provides for this printer.  Scanning can be cryptic if you have multiple hard drives and some of the other options take some playing with.  But the biggest issue is time to install (very slow and cumbersome) and potential problems with XP SP2.  I first ran into the problem when I installed the printer to my work laptop, worked great when I was at home but when I went back to the office I had several errors came up.  It got so bad where I couldn't access IE and some programs wouldn't run at all.  Even uninstalling didn't fix it, I had to do a system restore to before the software was installed.  Didn't happen on 2 home computers (at first).  Well, I recently had to reconfigure my router and when I did, I had turned off all computers and the printer before booting up the modem and router.  When it came up, I forgot to turn the printer back on and it made both computers go crazy.  And then, even though the printer was active and on the network, the 2 computers couldn't see the printer (yet they could ping it???).  After many hours of searching HP's website, I couldn't come up with any results and had to uninstall, system restore, then reinstall to fix the problem.  Was fine until once again the printer went offline, cause havock on the network.  I finally contacted HP and they sent me this link to install this patch.  When I did, it seems to have fixed everything.  I noted to them that the patch wasn't noted anywhere on the 2610's support page which I hope they have since repaired.

What attracted me to this particular model was decent printing specs in an all-in-one machine, coupled with the built-in networking. Plus, my wife objected to buying one of those ridiculously retro-looking new generation of HP deskjet printers (and I agree with her, those do look awful, what were they thinking?) It seems from other reviews here that many people have had bad experiences with the software setup of this printer. Well, to some extent I would agree, but it's not all that bad. I have the 2610 wired into a Linksys router, with two desktop computers and one (roaming) notebook on the network. The good part about setting it up: the software installed and worked the first time on all machines. I definitely do agree with another reviewer who commented on the huge amount of software being installed, HP should know that requiring almost 400MB worth of software just to get basic functionality working is ridiculous. I know, I work in the software business. This reeks of one of those outsourced, offshore jobs. Nonetheless, all my machines are up and running and able to use the machine. It sure beats the pants off my old print server setup which was flaky at best - I like the web-based interface on the 2610 which makes it easy to check ink levels, etc. Which brings me to the actual point: once successfully set up, the machine is actually very impressive! Print quality is hands down better than my old HP970 Deskjet, and a lot faster. Everything else works as expected: scanning is great, and the copying and fax functions are neat and quite intuitive to use. I like the functionality in this baby! I have not used the HP imaging software that comes with the machine, but my wife has played with it and had positive comments about it. So far, we are quite pleased with this purchase: it performs well and has reduced desktop clutter in our home office considerably. If not for the bulky software, I'd give this machine 5 stars for functionality. Let's hope HP addresses the problems other people have been experiencing with the software."

Having read reviews of other people I made sure that  I did everything according to HP installation instructions. Well... this did not help much.  I got this unit because it has built-in networking and because of my past very positive experience with HP networked printers: simple bullet-proof sofware. Not anymore!!!  Recommended installation is 740M, takes a long time and  trips up on anything. At first, simply connecting the printer to my router would bring the entire network down. Then it couldn't find the printer, then it congratulated me on a successful installation, but the printer driver never appeared, then....  The Customer Support first told me to download latest software of their website (standard BS answer). But the links there don't work. How lame is that? It shouldn't be this way! If you can, get something else. If you already got this one, here is a couple of perhaps useful things. 1) Power cycling while holding down # and 3 on the printer keypad does a partial reset of the printer.  Good for getting it out of its network funk.  2) Press ""setup"" on printer keypad  and go into ""network"" and set the IP to manual.  That prevented it from bringing the network down and allowed the computer to connect. Later it got reset to DHCP. Again, one shouldn't have to deal with this to install a $300 dollar printer."

When viewing a photo I can select print and it automatically prompts me with a wizard to help setup my print style and/or to add additional photos.   The installation of the software was a snap; I am not sure why other reviewers had issues with the installation.  I would have to guess that older computer may require you to wait 5 to 10 minutes after start up to install this software because of lack of memory.  This All-in-one is loaded with functionality and I could easily see a low end computer that was purchased many years ago having trouble with this printer.  The photo editing software is really nice, I especially love the red eye removal worked seamless and nearly automatically.  I am excited to start a few projects with this all-in-one and I can't wait to explore the additional functionality that I have yet to use."

Once I got it installed - and it's a long, long haul, I was stunned by its ease of use, ergonomics and of course print quality. I installed it as a network printer, so I just plugged the ethernet cable into the back of my netgear router, and that was pretty much all I needed to do (I use DHCP on the router). The menu navigation on the little screen (almost too bright) is logical and sensible. So: hardware setup is a doddle - I was faxing and copying within minutes of taking it all out of the box. Then came the agony, which I can handle psychologically because I'm a software engineer, but which I imagine many home users would weep at in despair. The installer for the printer drivers is a whopping 250 meg for the ""light"" install, and a good half gig for the full install. I went straight for the light install because I've never got a useful freebie with hardware! So: on computer 1, off I went. It made it half way through the install (about 10 mins) and then asked me for my windows 2000 disk. So I rummaged around and eventually found it, stuck it in. And some time later it said it couldn't find srgb.icm so I browsed and searched my entire machine and coudln't find it. I clicked cancel and the install didn't complain, but nothing worked. So I uninstalled and tried again, same thing. So I uninstalled and tried again. Eventually, after some googling, I discovered that srgb.icm IS in fact present in the DRIVER.CAB file (search for it). So I had to take the .icm file OUT of the driver.cab and then it was OK. So, installation on machine 1 took 4 hours. Yes, FOUR hours. Machine 2: This machine, which is also a Win2k machine, worked a little better. It didn't ask for a disk or that stupid file, and made it as far as the reboot (30 mins). When it came back up, the installer ran for about 5 mins, then 2 applications crashed (a popup message saying so appeared), then the installer sat there with no disk activity and no CPU for about 10 mins then disappeared. It just disappeared. So, rather than go through the whole process again, I just ran setup.exe from the CD, and it sort of managed to pick up where it left off and installed ok (at least I think so). HP have GOT to simplify their installers and their drivers. I loathe overblown stuff with desktop icons and system tray icons everywhere. All I want to know is that my printer EXISTS, that it's ON and that I can PRINT with it. If I want anything else, I want to be able to CHOOSE to install it. Anyway, all is right with the world now. I love the fact that you can plonk something in the scanner and tell it what computer to send it to, and what application (eg email or word) to squirt it in to. I really really want to give this printer 1 star or less to punish HP for their evil install, but the printer is so nice that I've got to give it 4 stars."

You can fax multiple pages at once, because after you press fax, it asks you to place document on scanner, it scans, it, and then it asks if you have another one.  Was worried you can only fax only one page at a time, but that is not the case.  Make sure you buy usb cable for it. It's not included inside.

Going through the installation software was easy enough. I previously had a HP LaserJet 1200 and a ScanJet scanner but the drivers for those apparently did not interfere with the installation. However, I wanted to address the issue raised by reviewer Martin Beck (Oct 29, 2005), wherein on a network where the IP addresses are dynamically assigned (DHCP), communication with the printer may fail occasionally if the IP address isn't the same as what's written in the host file (C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts). I agree that this is a ridiculously stupid thing for the software to do, so the key is to assign the printer a static IP address. Contrary to reviewer GAJer's assertion (June 12, 2005), this IS possible -- read the Network Guide booklet for instructions. You'll have to find an available static IP address by going to your router administration web site (on a Linksys router, it's 192.168.1.1, and it's 192.168.0.1 on a D-Link). Do this BEFORE you run the installation and you shouldn't experience any problems with communicating with the all-in-one. If you've already installed the software, you can still do this; just be sure to put the correct IP address in the host file afterwards."

I have tried adjusting the guides and the paper in tiny steps a hundred different ways and the printer still will not feed the paper properly.  I have to babysit every print job, feeding individual sheets into the printer.  If it is allowed more than one page in the tray it will invariably pull in three sheets then give me a paper jam error message.

To communicate my experience/opinion of the HP 2610, I will make a Pro/Cons list. I realize my review may be one-sided, but I am only speaking from experience. Pro: 1. After one year, it can still perform its scanning function. Cons: 1. Software installation *SHOULD* be quick and easy. It is only printer/scanner software and it is coming from a company with a history of making printers and scanners, BUT HP has lost its way! 2. If software installation doesn't crash, it may slow down the system when it does work. HP forces too many additional software programs with the simple print/scan function. 3. If one of the two ink cartridges fails or is missing, the working ink cartridge will not work until the other one is replaced. My color ink cartridge stopped working (I didn't even use it that much) and I was *unable* to make printouts that use only the black ink cartridge. 4. When the 2610 was able to print, it would very frequently print with missing strips of ink. This wasted a lot of ink and paper. I am uncertain if this is a defect in the cartridges or the print itself. 5. It became too difficult to connect the printer to the home network, so I just use its USB connection. In conclusion, the HP 2610 was a waste of money and time. I find more reliability and speed from my Canon 2110, which is old and outdated. The Canon 2110 may print VERY slow, but it makes up for it from its working software and consistency in being able to produce a successful printout, which is more than what I can say for the HP 2610.  HP was a leader in printing and scanning devices--I suspect their research team spent more time making foolproof ink cartridges than they did on improving functional printers."

I removed my old printing software and it went away. I give it a four. It is a space saver too about six or seven inches lower that the 7210. I don't know how much ink it will soak up yet. All I can say is lexmark is a guzzler and I wanted to try the HP.

When it works, it's great to be able to print from the laptop. I'll emphasize 'when it works.' Most of the time, the printer indicates it's connected but the networked features, such as downloading photos, don't actually work."

I use it for printing/scanning/copying and they all work great for me. I do not use it to print pictures so can't comment too much regarding this quality. Never had an issue with software like other people have noted, but I got too be honest, I only need the machine for basic work and don't monkey around with settings too much."

Now the bad.. *The printer (couple times daily) takes in and prints on 2 sheets of paper at a time rather than one. * The Software is landfill ready from the start. All it does is add about about 6 or 7 extra processes that are running in your task manager. The software constantly crashes and half the time I can't scan anything. So I have to resort to ""other"" methods to get this thing to scan to my pc. *The printer(at least mines) will not constantly print a black word document without color ink installed. For example yesterday without any color ink installed, I PRINTED black word documents. Today, without any color ink installed I COULD NOT print any black word documents. Where is the consistency?? Why is color ink not needed one day but needed another day in order to print a BLACK word document?? * Printer is suspect *Borderless 4-by-6 photo paper doesn't seem to print right on this printer on a reliable basis. Half the time the heads are cut off while the other half are ok. Where is the consistency?? *The print speeds reflect a mini diagram of our economy..Slow...Fast..Slower..somewhat Fast...Super duper slow...One second it spits the papers out so fast and violently that the papers flies out and hit the floor if you don't have the paper catcher extended all the way. The machine shakes my file cabinet as the papers just fly out one after another. So the next day comes, I'm expecting the same results except this time the printer takes it's slow precious time printing each and every letter ONE BY ONE. The same documents that flew out yesterday now print at a snails pace. When I purchased this printer no one told me that it had a human brain and printed fast or slow when it felt like it.................This thing is possessed If you can get this printer to thoroughly work then enjoy it and all it has to offer. If not get your hypertension meds out and some hair dye to cover the gray you will encounter while hassling with this thing. **Update** Installed brand new premium hp color ink. Printer will not print in color. Only Black ink....."

Now when i call help center im not able to reach anyone and treated like a criminal this is ridiculous just take this printer replace it no questions so i can continue using your expensive ink cartridges which by the way is how the company really makes its money but no they want to make me pay for a printer that actually shuts down after high user use, must be proprietary software embedded and encoded in printer to encourage more purchases my printer was never abused and kept in mint condition but used heavily for monster user"

The first one couldn't copy.  The second one made horrible screeching noises and the third seems to operate fine mechanically. But the software is nuts:  It randomly prints double copies of many documents -- which can be dangerous when compiling reports, etc. -- some docs print twice, others not at all.  And it gets into these insane loops where popup windows declare that the job is finished, delete?  This when it has never printed in the first place. The networking function also seems unreliable.  I could go on, but suffice it to say that though we are savvy users, we've burned-up many hours of staff time reboxing units to return, then reassembling new units (you have to keep the case!) -- and just routine printing is like trying to have a conversation with a crazy person. Over the past 25 years we've become spoiled by the excellent usability of most Mac software, and this product isn't even in the ballpark.

No bass/treble adjustments, so I have to route the sound thru an external amplifier to get the bass I want. The earphone output is is usually dead. I haven't had time to figure out under what situations it works or not. Since I'm using an external amp, I simply plug the phones into it, anyway. I suspected these problems might be related to my Windows 98SE, so I installed a friend's Windows XP Pro on a different partition, and ALL the same problems existed there, too! There are no new drivers on the manufacturer's web site to try. Sorry, I've run out of ideas, so I can't recommend this sound card."

A recent BETA driver has been released for LEOPARD (10.5.X) and fixes the problem with the audio console not popping up in the System Preferences pane.  DVD movies play great from the card: in particular through it's digital coax system as well as it's analog connection. Games like QUAKE 4 and DOOM 3 have issues with the Revolution 5.1.  Quake will either have the sound ""popping"" or ""skipping"" in intervals or at times a kernel panic happens, thus crashing the game.  Doom 4 wont play audio AT ALL with the use of the Revolution 5.1.  Both games that have the EAX HD sound option for your game, but it won't work with the 5.1 even though the card supports such audio features from these games.  I've had no problems with games like Return to Castle Wolfenstien, Return to Castle Wolfenstien: Enemy Territory, and Quake 3 Arena when using the 5.1. In runs great with WINDOWS VISTA and haven't heard from anyone I know, any problems with playing ANY games on their PC's. M-Audio in my opinion, should have discontinued this card if it wasn't going to make the effort in maintaining FULL SUPPORT for users that STILL use their Apple G4 and G5 (PCI-X) systems.  Both systems are expandable (G5 PCI-X has some limitations) and are powerful enough to run current software and will last in years to come.

Why buy a 5.1 card for just a stereo setup?  Because I wanted the M-Audio brand, as well as the capability for future multi-speaker setups. This card does not come with overblown software that has all sorts of sound effects and environments, most of which are useless.  If you want something that cleanly reproduces the sound source and relays it to your speakers, then this is the one to get. A nice plus is it comes with a very versatile InterAudio's WinDVD program that does a great job of decoding and viewing DVD's. Also, to finally address many complaints about this product not being compatible with Vista and having older drivers, M-Audio has finally released updated drivers that are compatible with Vista.  Go to the support section of their website and download them.  I am using XP and had no trouble whatsoever setting anything up. In short, this is a reliable soundcard that does what it was intended to do without a bunch of bloatware toys that come with other manufacturer's cards that alter the signal and use up your computer's resources."

After installation of the card and drivers from the supplied CD the default output was set to analog.  Definitely above average sound quality.  Tried switching to digital - couldn't get it to output from the coax digital out at first, but then for some unexplainable reason it started working.  However, this card does not output digital and analog at the same time (like the M-Audio Audiophile 2496 that I wound up replacing it with).  You have to open the  Revolution 5.1 control panel and switch it from analog to digital.  Therein was the issue.  It didn't want to let go of whichever state it was in at the time.  I would have to restart Windows sometimes to get it to let go of the analog or digital when going from normal computer use to home theater usage or vice versa.  Did some research and come to find out other people are having problems with this card.  I think there's something wrong with the drivers for XP and the most recent driver on the website is dated like 2004.  Tried the most recent drivers (a few months more recent than the ones on the supplied CD).  Nothing - no change.  Gave up and sent it back to Amazon - replaced it with the aformentioned 2496 (which actually has recent driver support).  Works much better for me, however I only need stereo analog out to my computer speakers.  For those who actually need a 5.1 card, keep looking."

Installing was a snap and I had a small issue getting all my speaker's working, but I got that fixed by visiting the M-Audio website, looking into the FAQ's for Mac, and downloading the latest updates.

Also, the sound regularly has encoding errors (scratching noises, latency, etc.). After M-Audio released the beta drivers (5 months later!), the encoding errors were mostly gone and most games had sound - except for games using the Quake sound-engine (M-Audio acknowledged this issue). QuickTime audio only works with some codecs (so far I couldn't quite figure out which work and which don't). It's almost March now and all M-Audio answers when asked for new drivers is that they are working on it - which obviously they are not! I can only recommend to all Mac users NOT TO BUY THIS CARD!

Unfortunaley, in the case of M-Audio's Revolution 5.1 card, an official driver for the current version of Mac OS X still does not exist more than half a year after Tiger's release. The supplied driver works intermittently at best. The only beta driver I can find causes my G4 to completely freeze intermittently when I try to watch DVDs and there are frequent very loud snapping and crackling sounds. The M-Audio website has a statement warning customers that there is no guarantee that this product will work with newer operating systems, even though this product is still being sold and it's official system requirements suggest is it compatible with Mac OS X 10.2.6 and greater. In reality, compatability is with 10.2.6 through 10.3 only. I should note, that when the product works, which is rare, DVDs and iTunes sound quite good playing though the coaxial (no optical output is present) digital output from the card.

We have two of them in two different doorways to our kitchen.  One of the doorways is quite over-sized and this gate stretches across quite nicely without getting slack in the middle. If you have trimwork at the bottom of your wall, you will need to get an additional wall installation kit--or rig your own with some pieces of wood.  Make sure you mount these gates as close to to the ground as possible--ours are mounted immediately above the trimwork and this leaves about a 1.5-2 inch gap between the bottom of the mesh gate and the floor.  Definitely not enough room for our wiggleworm to squeeze through! We've had these gates long enough that I'm now a pro at opening and closing them one-handed--well, I do use my foot to assist with guiding the bottom of the gate.  My husband, however, is not as well-practiced and for him it is virtually impossible to hold our toddler on one hip while operating the gate. We're both tall (I'm 5'10"" and he's 6') and it is possible for us to just step over the gate--although it is getting tougher for me because I'm pregnant again.  Still, if you're much shorter than 5'10"", you will likely need to open the gate every time you want to get through. Our daughter is a climber and likes to climb on top of everything--but this gate is impossible for her to climb because there literally are NO footholds--not even at the bottom of the gate!! We love that this gate retracts--at the end of the day after our little one is in bed, we retract the gate and have a regular open doorway again. I highly recommend this gate!"
600369,A1MO3CYR3NMRLS,0,0,14,B0002YOGS6,2/19/2006,3,16,16,"great idea, crappy instructions","I bought two of these gates because I love the idea of it being out of the way. One area was the top of the steps which has no room for a swing gate whatsoever. The opening is wider than the space between the steps and the wall behind it. Also another one for a hallway that I only rarely use so I didn't want to be fighting with the free-swinging gate 99% of the time. The instructions SUCK. They are also in four different languages, so you might miss some things. However installation is really pretty straightforward. Once I did one, I had the other one up in 20 minutes without even looking back at the directions. The gate CAN be opened one handed, if you read the instructions! On the last page, it tells you how. You do the the button push down/in/out tango, and then you can let go, and the gate is unlocked and you have one shot at connecting it. Ditto opening it. It's one extra step but once I figured that out I like it a lot better. If you miss, you have to retract it and try again. With practice you'll be doing it on the first shot. This is probably not a gate for high traffic areas where you're going to be doing it 100 times a day, it would drive me nuts! I've found that if I grab the roll and turn it to make it click tighter once more, the gate will be more taught and harder for a child to get under it. I tried to get under it and I don't see my 21 month old fitting under it if I tighten it by grabbing the roll.  I think my younger baby will be too big to fit under it before he can figure out that he might be able to do that. This gate can hold weight, my installation is SOLID, however the weak point in the gate is the little holes in the edge of the gate itself that catch the hooks on the wall. I really, really wish this was longer (and weather-proof)! It would be perfect for my front porch! The handle is a pain. You have to install it based on which way you will use the gate. However, I would like a handle on BOTH sides! It's really hard to snap in, and if you have to remove it (either because you put it in wrong or because you want to move the gate to another location) then it's really difficult to get out. The instructions say ""hardware allows gate to be easily removed"" HA! There is no way this thing is coming off without a screwdriver. It makes a loud clicking sound when open or closed, but that's so you know it's happening! If you have it near where it would wake a sleeping baby, you can hold down the button while you're pulling it in/out and it will not make the noise. The wall mount kit is just 2 plastic plates. This way you can insall the gate on a wall with moulding. It means you have to drill through your moulding since you can't move the mounts and the gate must be flush with the floor (or a child could really get under it) In my opinion the kit should be included, but is a $20 accessory. www.comfort1st.com is giving the kits away with the gate for free, and has free shipping (as of the writing of this review) You could just use a spare piece of thick plywood and some long screws. All that's included in this kit is extra long screws and a pretty plastic plate that matches all the other hardware. That's my wordy review and observations. I hope it helps you decide."

All the gates that needed to be used for the staircase were all big, and swung one way or the other. We have a 3 story home so I would need 2 gates and just couldnt imagine having a big bulky gate ALWAYS there. I also couldnt imagine going upstairs while carrying my baby and having to use a gate that required you to press a foot peddle and use one hand at the same time! I came across these gates and knew it was what I needed. You can operate it with one hand if needed. The retract almost completely so you dont notice them when not in use. The hold up to 250 pounds of pressure against them to be sure of safety around stairs. There are also no parts that make it easy for a baby or toddler to climb. We have two large cats and one small dog (15 pounds each for the cats and 3 pounds for the dog) and they have found ways around the gates when up. They slink under the opening on the floor that is naturally there from our baseboard molding. Our daughter has witnessed this and is fascinated by it, however she has not tried to emulate them or go after them. If you are in the market for a gate to be used on your staircases then these are the only ones worth buying in my opinion."

The top of the gates was hard to keep secure (the part that locks it in place is plastic), and the second problem: the wind-up mechanism broke!  This gate is almost made of ALL PLASTIC, inside and out.  The plastic pieces that keep the spring loaded thing wound-up inside malfunctioned.  We had to take the whole thing apart, it took us over an hour to fix it. If the gate was made out of a harder, stronger plastic, and had METAL pieces inside to keep it working well, it would be an awesome gate.  It is good idea, and it is nice to have it out of the way when it is rolled up.  BUT, for the price of this gate, it should not be made out so much plastic!"

So far, so good.  We used the wall installation kit to attach it to the wall and the bannister installation kit to attach it to the bannister on the other side.  By the way, it works with both round and square bannisters. We really like that way that it retracts out of the way.  The only issue is that it makes a loud clicking noise while opening it, unless you hold the release latch while letting it retract -- that, however, requires two hands.

A few words of caution.  It's not the easiest to install due to the flexible nature of the gate. Can you do it? Yes, but it will take about an hour. Second, expect it simply to ""hold back"" your child from a room or a tumble down the stairs.   That is, I wouldn't trust it to withstand a running start and certainly not a climb.  For the top of a stairway, you might want to consider installing another type of gate.  Third, one handed operation is virtually impossible. Not a problem for us, but simply something to know."

I love how the gate is retractable for times when our baby is asleep and we don't need one in our way. I also feel confident that my children can not push, pull or tear it apart.

We've been using the gate for a few months (since he started crawling) and had the same problems others mentioned (i.e., the button is not easy to maneuver and it is definitely not a one-handed operation).  In addition, the gate would occasionally retract unevenly (the top would be out of line with the bottom) and the mesh looks like it is stretched out at the top.  Don't rely on this product for your child's safety at the top of the stairs (I've reported the incident to the CPSC)."

I didn't find anything else like it. Installation of course varies with the construction of your home.  I had to adapt to make this one work.  A more flexbile mounting would be nice.  Expect some customization if the mounting sufaces aren't flat and uniform. Unfortunately, the device no longer automatically retracts after less than 1 year.

I didn't want a swinging gate because it would have to swing into our entry way and that just didn't work for me. I also didn't want one that we had to put up and down multiple times a day. After reading all the reviews we thought this gate would be perfect. As a previous reviewer wrote, the directions really do suck and are WAY more complicated than anything should be except for perhaps brain surgery.  Also, it sucks to open and close this thing.  I'm sure if I did it 100 times I'd get good at it but all it did was frustrate us both to no end.  Why do things need to be so complicated?? Bottom line, you cannot install this gate with uneven openings without doing some serious modification (we had molding at the bottom and banisters at the top - with a width difference of over an inch).  We were trying to add wood here and there and zip tie this and screw that in here but not there, etc.  It was a nightmare. We now have to send it back and pay a ""buyer's remorse"" 15% restocking fee and what did we buy to replace it?  A swinging, white, metal gate that has to stick out into our entry way once the tot goes to bed (we have cats - it needs to be open). (Note - we didn't buy the Kiddy Guard from this site - we bought from Comfort First as they include the shipping. They have this gate installed at our Gymboree class and it works ok there (other than the ridiculous dance you need to do to open it).  It goes between two walls with no molding, no stairs, no gaps.  I will say, because it's white mesh, it looks a little ratty after so much use and that concerned me a bit as well. Someone needs to make a metal gate with a sliding door, instead of a swinging door. My two cents."

The opening for the stairs is also much wider than most so this was one of the few gates that would fit.  This gate is also in a high traffic area so we're constantly opening and closing it.  We've had it for more than a year and have been very pleased with it. It took us a few tries to get used to opening and closing it but now we're pros.  You can open it silently which is good once the baby is in bed. I would recommend this for anyone because the gate doesn't swing out, requies only one hand, is wider than many and completely retracts when it is not needed.  It also works good with a variety of stair railing configurations (we bought the spindle/wrought iron adapter kit)."

I can operate the gate with one hand while holding a baby.  I never have anything to trip over, and once the baby is down for the night I can open these gates and have the house free of navigation hazards for the adults.  That's been great--I'm not trapped in a baby prison in the evening. I don't know why other people have had problems with these gates,  maybe have had installation issues?  Make sure you use a level when setting up the gate to make it vertical.  I made adaptors for my banister out of wood in my garage--you don't need to always buy stuff.

600351,A3LZ5RWMJLXO4Q,0,1,26,B0002YTN4I,12/27/2007,5,6,6,"Excellent Product, Does what it says!","I opted for the ""12000"" series because they are a little wider and my vehicle has wide tires.  The ""8000"" series were about an inch thinner.  They will work great for most cars, however I am using them on a vintage Porsche that rides very low.  Out of the box these ramps will not work on cars that sit really low or have a front spoiler as the spoiler will hit the ramp before the tires do.  My solution was to was to create some ramp extenders by bolting a piece of wood to each ramp to give the approach less of an dramatic incline.  The ramps have a hole that accepts a bolt, -probably for mounting to the floor of your garage or a strip of wood if you want. In any case, be aware that you may have to get a little creative if you have a sports car that has a low spoiler."
600350,AJGMBO4LODBRK,0,1,25,B0002YTN4I,5/2/2009,5,5,5,Decent ramps,"I actually found these,the 12,000 lb ramps at Pep Boys here in LA for $45 (special this week I think). Price here seems a bit on the high side. The ones I got were black, which is preferable IMO. Yes, they are plastic - but very sturdy. My care is an Sl Merdedes, total weight 4200 lbs, but I'm safety minded so I purchased the 12,000 pound model. NOTE: this is for vehicle Gross weights up to 12,000. Not *each ramp*. Each of these ramps is rated at 3000 lbs weight. They do work well, are easy to drive up onto, the stop at the end is certainly sufficient, and they provide enough space under the car for oil changes. I am going to change my transmission filter, and that will be a bit more difficult. All in all, they seem to be decent, rugged ramps. Useful mainly for oil changes. SAFETY NOTE: as they are plastic, you should inspect them periodically for signs of cracking. Over time, plastics may degrade and become brittle or lose their strength. ALSO: Do not use solvents to clean these - some solvents can degrade plastics. To be safe, use detergent based degreasers for cleaning."
600349,AO1L9IX0LZNJ5,0,0,24,B0002YTN4I,7/11/2009,5,2,2,Simple and easy,I was trying to decide between buying a hydrolic jack versus a ramp for oil changes on my 97 BMW 328i.  I used to use my dad's jack and saw that one of our neighbors used a ramp and simply drove his car up to get underneath.  Jacks were about $100 where these ramps were a lot less.  They have anti-slip pads which prevented the ramps from sliding as I drove up them and the wheel well helps you easily identify when your car is position.  Plenty of clearance for my oil change.  Product is heavy duty yet light weight so easy to store.  Great choice for amateurs and cheapskates like me.

In the last three weeks I have been playing jazz, rock, classical and folk music from CDs, vinyl and FM.  The reproduction of the music over the range of styles and sources has been great.  I have always owned speakers built with the Air Suspension design : AR, Yamaha, and Boston Accoustic.  I was concerned that these speakers, with their  ported rear vent, might be to lively.  I was pleasantly suprised. The highs are clear, the midrange is fine and the bass is very good.  I have the speakers placed about 15 feet apart and 18 to 24 inches away from a back wall.  The stereo image is very good.  These speakers are a real bargain."
600324,A2BKHUH3DHBM22,0,1,28,B0002YY1HW,9/30/2005,5,42,42,Finally!  A multi-line corded phone that works.,"I've been looking for a multi-line corded phone for months, and thought I'd found what I wanted in the AT&T 992, which recently became available.  It had all the features I was looking for, but the phone did not work reliably.  I bought and returned three of them, all with a different problem. I then decided to try this phone, the 974, even though it's a 4-line phone and I only need two lines.  It has worked perfectly, and the overall quality is much better than the 992.  I especially notice a difference in the sound quality.  Unlike the 992, the line indicator buttons on this phone only illuminate when a line is in use, so it's much easier to see the activity on the lines.  A big advantage of this phone over many others is that all the lines work in the event of a power outage. I haven't used the conference feature yet, but all the other features--speakerphone, headset, caller ID, message waiting indicator, etc.--work as they should."
600323,A2R37EWT0FX9O8,0,0,27,B0002YY1HW,2/18/2006,5,18,18,"Fabulous phone, superb design.","Previous reviewer was right! This phone is attractively designed and works great with many features. It's the ideal home office phone. It's rare when you plug in a device for the first time that you get a feeling that a lot of thought and effort went into design. When I plugged in this phone I got that feeling when the brief test mode lit up the orange and green lights on the buttons- very nice designed lights! So far using this phone, I have no complaints, just a very minor gripe- if you talk too close to the mic in the handset it causes an annoying static type sound in the earpiece (wind blast noise). This is easily avoidable by talking at least 1 inch from the mic. Still, maybe noise reduction might have prevented this, not sure. Except for that minor quibble this phone is a masterwork of design and function. I wanted white color but now I really do like the Titanium Blue color it comes in, and it doesn't look blue at all to me, it looks like a dark grey to me (which I like). Even though this is a 4 line phone, it's ideal for just one line use as well, which is how I'm using it for now. I can not review yet how well the multiline and conference features work since I'm only using one line at the moment. Even though this phone is expensive, it was the only phone I could find that had all of the features I wanted that worked well. I started with an ATT $24 phone, then the ATT 945 (which doesn't have caller ID) and finally this one, which has caller ID. I was also replacing a cordless phone because I needed a speakerphone, but also because I had recently heard that cordless phones send out as much EMF radiation as cell phones! The cordless base may also send out strong levels of EMF even when the phone is not in use. That kind of bothered me, since I sit by the phone almost all day long at home office. I found that you can buy an EMF detector that can measure EMF levels from devices in your home. I haven't done that yet but I think I will eventually. Since I sit by my phone almost all day I decided to replace the cordless with a corded and eliminate any possible EMF. The main features I was looking for: speakerphone, headset option, mute, call timer, caller id, good audio (with volume control), and easy to read LED. It has these and much more. This phone has a superbly designed headset setup- plug in a headset (2.5mm plug) and switch very easily between the headset/handset/speaker, before, or even in the middle of a call. Be cautious of cheaper phones that have headset use but may not be easy to switch easily like this (requires a headset button). The large LED has a bright green background that displays the black text very sharply and the menu system is easy to use. I figured out how to set the speed dial buttons without the manual. A column of 16 speed dial buttons on the right is nicely designed (each can hold 2 numbers for a total of 32). Push a speed dial, it dials immediately on speaker if you want. Speed dial buttons are easy to push and not too small (unlike lower cost models). All the buttons and controls on this phone are so well designed it's actually fun to use! When I first setup a speed dial, it didn't dial but opened the intercom. I quickly found the preference setting to make it dial, again without looking in the manual. By the way, the manual is very good. When on a call, the call timer shows length of call. (some lower cost ATT models do not) This phone has intercom/page capability but I haven't used it yet. I tested the Do Not Disturb function- push the DND button and it lights up orange and silences the ringer- I called it and it did not ring- nice for when you do not want to be disturbed- yet it flashes the line button (green) if a call is coming in. A ""New Call"" light indicates when a call came in when you were away from the phone. Scroll thru the caller ID history to see who called. This phone has no answering system- this is ok with me because I use local phone co. as my answering service. The handset is very lightweight and the receiver sounds very good. The microphone in the handset is the only thing about the phone that might be improved, it would benefit from noise reduction, otherwise just remember to talk at least 1 inch from the mic in the handset to avoid the wind blast noise. I find this a very minor gripe because otherwise this phone is fabulous in every other way. The other thing I needed to do was replace the included short 3 foot handset cord with a longer one, but would have had to do that with most other new phones as well."
600322,AB0RQLXNCW52E,0,0,26,B0002YY1HW,4/18/2006,1,13,14,speakerphone has problems,"I purchased 3 of these for my office back in October.  First the speakerphone microphone on the one on my desk stopped working most of the time.  I had been planning on exchanging the phone on my desk with a coworkers since I use the speakerphone on a daily basis.  My investors were out this week and were on a conference call on another of the phones, that microphone stopped working.  Today I had a phone interview and the THIRD phone microphone stopped working!  They work for 15 or 20 seconds, then the party on the other end can't hear you.  These are gone.  I was also hoping for a visual indicator that there were messages waiting when you use Verizon Centrex/voicemail.  No go there."

I do not use this in a large environment, so I can't speak to how well it transfers calls or deals with that sort of life - I have a single small office and suits my needs well. The only thing that I don't like about it is not really a fault of the phone, it is a fault of my own for not looking for a phone with it in the first place - but I want a phone that can talk to my computer. Pass the caller id on to my computer, log, screen, etc - I am in the software business and would like more control over anything in my office. This phone is basic, but has every feature a small office would need."
600320,AD8V22OGADW6G,0,1,24,B0002YY1HW,4/28/2007,4,8,8,"Works fine for us, with one exception","We use an AT&T 974 speakerphone in our small business. It works fine for us, and the built-in caller id display is a big help. It will even display incoming caller information when the line is in use, if you have the ""caller ID on hold"" feature from the phone company. The only big drawback we've found so far is with the ""hold"" feature. When you put a call on hold and pick up on another extension which is not one of the compatible AT&T models, the AT&T 974 does not release the line. After the extension is hung up, the AT&T 974 keeps the line on hold for 30 minutes! AT&T says this feature only works properly with other compatible models made by AT&T. It's an inconvenience, to be sure, and for our household, where we have seven phones, a big investment which we haven't been able to justify yet."

We are in a two phone line office and just wanted a simple phone that we could use to answer either line and not have to read a huge manual to figure out how it worked.  This was the phone for us!  Great volume, speakerphone option, with several other nice options like speed dial, call timers, and caller ID.  For the price, we feel like we got quite a good phone and more features than we thought we'd need- but like the extras all the same.  I highly recommend this phone."
600318,AKP9TZ5JPB2O4,0,1,22,B0002YY1HW,7/20/2008,4,6,6,"Overall, a Functional Product","The AT&T 974 is a good small business phone.  There are only two problems with it, and these appear to be common with all of the AT&T small business multi-line phones.  (1) AT&T frequently introduces new models and discontinues the previous ones.  Unfortunately, they do not make the intercom, and some other features, backwards-compatible.  So, if you want to get the most from your system, you have to upgrade all the phones in the office.  This model is discontinued, and it's replacement--I think it's the 1074--causes all sorts of problems with the 974s in the office (intercom, transfer, hold, for example).  (2) When you're on a call, there should be an option to mute, or partially mute, the ringer on the other lines.  It's distracting to have the phone ring at full volume when you're trying to talk to somebody else.  You can press the ""do not disturb"" button, but if you forget to turn off ""do not disturb"" when you hang up, you'll miss subsequent calls."
600317,A3VTPJ8UB8TEO6,0,1,21,B0002YY1HW,12/11/2007,3,6,6,AT&T 974 phone,"I bought 3 of these. I did my homework in reading all the reviews and still chose this phone as it was the only one at a reasonable price that would do what I thought I wanted it to do. First - The color - ""ick"" - I guess I thought it meant a *dark* charcoal gray/blue but it is more of a *light* gray/blue.  It certainly does not match anything in an office setting, but I'm more concerned with the function than the color. Second - The function - The handset if comfortable to hold but you need to make sure it is exactly on your ear and mouth or you lose the quality.  I like to hold the phone cradled in my neck freeing both hands to work while talking but that isn't possible as you lose the sound quality. I know .. use a headset, but I don't. I have one in the home office and one in the kitchen. If I answer in the office and  someone leaves the office to get the extension  in the kitchen, they cannot answer it until you put yours on *hold* or you transfer the call to that extension, the same goes if it is a phone that is ""not"" a compatible phone.  It seems you  have to put it on hold in order to release it to someone on another phone. The intercom feature works good.  The third phone is in another building.  I can intercom to that extension phone instead of walking across the parking lot and instead of  using one line to call another line thus tying up two phone lines.  I have not tried the call transfer yet but I assume it works okay. I checked room monitor just for the fun of it.  I don't really need this and it probably could be interpreted as an invasion of privacy.   But I can sit in the home office and turn on room monitor in the other building and listen to see if the Employees are playing around instead of working, or if they are ""talking about me""  ha ha.  This feature to me seems to be a waste.  I would much rather that AT&T put music on the hold button.  I put someone on hold for over a minute just to test the feature.  They said it was dead silence while they were on hold.  I heard the 30 second reminder beep. It is unfortunate that there is no compatible cordless phone.  When I intercom or transfer a call to the extension in the other building, they have to RUN across the building to answer the call.  It would be nice to have a portable to carry to answer the intercom. I would have given 4 stars for the operation of the system, but I'm giving 3 stars for the no music on hold and no compatible cordless phone for intercom and transfer. I could not even consider giving 5 stars because of the quality of the handset."

Without spending thousands on a complicated system we got what we wanted for under 500. Currently we have 2 lines and a fax line, they all work perfect.  The intercom and transfer have saved lung power (reducing hot air therefore reducing global warming, thank me Al Gore) and leg energy!  Now would like to add 2 more phone lines if I can get my wiring straightened out to make the most of the phones! Speakerphone is the only thing that is sort of a blah.

They work just fine. I especially like the separate headset jack button on the phone (no need to lift the handset). I use an inexpensive Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset (about $15) and it works perfectly. This phone is also available at Costco's website for $120 and can be returned for a full refund if you're not completely satisfied.

Since sound does not typically pick up well from even a couple feet away I plan on sending them back once I find an alternative. Sometimes it does pick up ok, although faintly for the person on the other end of the line. Other times, then report that my voice is not only faint, but also cutting in and out. The speaker itself does not put out sounds in very good quality. You will turn up the volume trying to hear better and it will become distorted, like a cell phone speakerphone.

It usually works OK, and we don't have a LOT of problems with these phones (we've got 6 of them), but those that we do have are deal-killers. Things to note: 1) The speakerphone REALLY WORKS VERY POORLY. That's something you'll see over and over in these posts. It actually seems to get progressively worse, until it simply stops working. You might not think that's a big deal, but I assure you, it is. 2) Poor ergonomic design. It's simply not well-built and ergonomically configured. You'll see that over and over in these posts. 3) The warranty service is ATROCIOUS. I hope you never have to deal with it, but if you do, I can tell you that you might as well just forget it and buy a new one for $127. 4) This phone is not compatible with ANY other phones, AT&T or not. You can't replace ONE of these POSs with a new one after it stops working after one year----you've got to replace ALL of them. It should be noted that this phone is NOT actually made by AT&T; it's made by some no-name company that bought rights to the AT&T name.....SO, if you expect that you'll have AT&T support or back-up on this phone, you are completely wrong.

We bought the phone initially because we wanted a phone with a good speaker phone option.   However, the speaker is giving us many problems.  If we make a phone call using the speaker phone, the person on the other end does not hear our voice.   We must pick up the handset before the other party can hear us.    I wrote to Amazon and explained the problem and they immediately exchanged the phone for a new one.  Unfortunately, the same thing is happening now with the new phone too.  At first I thought this may have something to do with the phone service, so I called the phone service in - but they verified it is not the service.

The zipper, stitching and wheels seem okay, although not overly impressive.  The handle feels a little thin.  The handle is long, so when you walk, it doesn't bang into your ankle or calf.  The handle also latches open, so you can push it in front of you if you need to. **UPDATE** I've been using this for a month now as a rolling tool case.  It's working out okay, but I'm treating it with kid gloves.  It does feel like it will not last if you start throwing it into the back of you car, or useing it roughly.

There is no good space for storing the 110 volt power unit and the cord.  I put it in the mesh bag but, that is not very good.  The space to hold the laptop is OK but I had to create a method to hold the laptop secure as this is not a standard part of the case.

First on my list was the DOOM series. So I sat down and in a couple of hours had played through DOOM. To me, this game married a couple of fun elements (although I don't know if it was the first, Wolfenstein might have done this), the first-person shooter and the collection games like Metroid. At the end of each level you're presented with your stats, and I don't know about you, but I play levels over and over until I've found 100% of all kills, items, and secrets. Although I don't know of any bonus for doing this, I'm just a little obsessive about details. In terms of game play, I was happy at how well this game holds up. It is simple but still challenging, especially if you play some of the more difficult skill levels and there is loads of replay value as you try and collect all the items or shave time or use less ammo or play with a higher difficultly level, etc. I've always found the plot to be intriguing, this was why I was so happy with DOOM 3.

The noise cancellation was well below my expectations, thye did cut down the noise but not by much. You get what you pay for I suppose. The biggest problem I had was that when I listened to something with these headphones people around me could hear it too. Not very helpful for me as I study at the library most of the time. People around you can hear everything you are listening to. I also tried a cheaper pair of Maxell noise cancelling headphones which were about the same performance-wise. With the Maxell headphones the sound did not leak out, so people around me could not hear what I was listening to. Noise-cancelling-wise, these were a little better than the Maxell headphones. One strage thing I noticed was that whenever I used these while studying in the university library and turned on the noise-cancelling, I started to hear some radio talk show station. strange!! the headphones were actually picking up radio waves!! not much fun when u are trying to cancel out noise. Also on one side the copper wires were exposed!! wouldnt recommend buying them.

I have used them to listen to a training course via my laptop, while flying --- the audio came across very clear. Same thing while listening to airline-pilot chatter during flights. I'm happy and satisfied.  MGM - Tulsa"

I ended up purchasing 3 for my family.  All of us are very satisfied with the purchase. Bought a more expensive pair of headphones from COSTCO, but I returned them, they were too uncomfortable (too tight- pressed my ears to my head and I don't have a big head).  Thought more expensive would mean a better product, WRONG.

600266,APPWHGHE6N2VF,0,1,9,B0002Z45CC,8/16/2005,4,14,14,Flexible works at all levels,"This is a interesting software package to work with because you can be happy with it as a beginner who just 'picks and clicks' and also as an advanced user controlling layers, masks and color channels, vector drawing and painting tools allow you to tweak to your heart's desire. You can get very good results with little knowledge with just the single 'autofix' button or choose from the multitude of preset buttons for creating lots of standard corrections and effects such as correcting under or overexposure. The software is even capable of changing the 'look' of the preset buttons (whose size can be controled/changed) to a 'preview' of the change to your photograph. The presets are a scripts of various individual tools. You can create your own scripts, combining tools in any order you wish. You can also work with each tool independently either with presets for that specific tool or by using the controls to create your own degree of effect. You can also batch process photos, so if you have repetative tasks such as embeding a copyright or making smaller thumbnails of a group of photos you can create a script and run it against a group of photos. Almost every tool, allows you to see simultaneous before and after views (side by side) of the change or a split screen before and after combination of the photograph being changed. You can also apply any effect as a 'preview' and can undo any tool, script to any level. One of the great preset tools in the package is the ""Beautify Skin"" tool. Removes acne with just a click! Better than ProActive or Stridex! This tool can be used as a spot remover; as a way to even skin tone or give someone a tan. Perfect for your kids whose skin is not always perfect. I particularly like the choice of selection tools. Besides the standard selection by color or lasso, you can 'choose' with several different methods and tools. They have a smart extraction tool that lets you paint a broad outline of the area(s) you want to select and the software does the dirty work (provided there is enough contrast/color difference) to give you a fine division between the subjects. The video shows them selecting out a pug from a photograph and using him on a geometric background created with other tools. Layers, paths, 3D, animation, and the ability to use 3rd party Photoshop (.8bf type) plugins are also part of the package's features. Additional effects such as adding ""Lightning"" to a shot can be lots of fun. I have a shot of the top of the Pierre Hotel in NYC taken on a bright sunny day, which looks like 'sleeping beauty's castle' and turned it into one with a lightning strike on a dark night. There are lots of interesting effects, and some great frame overlays, backgrounds and objects in the package.  You can cut out the backgrounds and put fireworks or overlay the fireworks on existing backgrounds just to name a few. Photo Web pages complete with thumbnails, rollovers, javascript can also be generated. The biggest bonus of the package is that it comes with Video lessons and there are additional lessons available on the Ulead website. I admit that there are some areas that are confusing in the manual, but they are made up by the clarity of the videos and the additional tutorials on the web site. Be prepared to spend a lot of happy time playing with your photographs. The Suite contains some additional software, a GIF Animator, a Photo Explorer, Cool 360 for making panarama and a vrml type experience There is also software to burn slideshow CD's for your TV, Lots of fun."

Since I used version 5 for a number of years the learning curve for me was pretty flat.  I do especially like the touch-up feature as I do photo touch up frequently. The clone features are still there as well as a red eye repair which I often see with pictures taken with digital cameras. I do appreciate the simplfied version of the tool bar which appears at the top when a tool is selected and the ease of toggling to a full version of the tool features on the right of the screen with a simple tab to move in and it out of the way for a full view.  A really great product worth the money.  Might take the novice to photo editing a bit of time to find all the ""goodies"" but well worth spending a bit of time to learn.."

I am very happy with this. I have only two complaints so far: (1) My 48 bit scans must be converted to 24 bit before most editing operations are possible. I think Ulead wants me to buy PhotoImpact 11 to remedy that. (2) My major complaint is that I cannot obtain a clean cloning line. The ability to set percentage of color drawn from the source, and to set percentage of soft edge in application make for a wonderful improvement over the free Adobe PhotoDeluxe software I replaced, but I sorely miss being able to clean right up to the edge of a colored area in an image. PI 10 pulls color from the adajacent field if you get really close, and this is extremely frustrating."

The ability to work with layers is lacking, and being able to interact with individual items can be trying at times, but for less experienced users, PhotoImpact can be an invaluable tool. For the casual photo editor and layperson, PhotoImpact is very user friendly, and can complete many tasks using wizards, or easy to use previews (provided you utilize the excellently laid out Easy Palette).  The Component Designer makes it easy to create buttons and icons for web site design that are easily customizable and present a professional looking result.  The materials galleries allow you to create excellent three-dimensional effects in objects, ranging from glassy and transparent to shiny metal, to rock or almost any other texture you might desire.  Compared to PhotoShop, this is quite easy to accomplish, and quick to view without taking up quite as much memory. All in all, I would recommend this for someone who does not care to poke and prod at the minutiae of editing that you can only do in PhotoShop, as regardless, this is a powerful program with many redeeming features."

My wife first started learning by looking over my shoulder, then one day, she wanted to play with the program herself. Within a few weeks, and without looking at any manuals or ""How-To"" books, my wife had become quite a good banner and button maker. Since then, we have come a long way in our website skills and our desire to mold our images into new creations. We have also purchased a camera in the last year, which was my first digital one. Not only is this program great for beginners to start making their own web graphics, but it is also an excellent software to turn good pictures into portraits like the pros. This program by far, is just shy of having all the bells and whistles of one of its top contenders: Photoshop CS2 One difference: You don't have to be a webmaster guru or photo fanatic to start making the program do what you want it to do. My wife and I both agree, that the learning curve is definetly more difficult on Photoshop, than PhotoImpact, by far. One other thing about this, is COST. As stated, PhotoImpact has basically all the extras and tools as its competitor Photoshop, but PhotoImpact costs less!. The cost of PhotoImpact and all its other free tools such as gif animator, cool 360, and Photo Explorer are even less than just an ""upgrade"" on the other software program. Why pay just for an upgrade code when you can have an entire set of tools at your disposal for a fraction of the upgrade cost? If you buy the boxed CD, you also get an in depth manual that helps to explain all the possibilities PhotoImpact 10 can do. For anyone wanting to fix digital photos, or make their own web graphics without having a 4 year degree to figure it out, or spending way to much money to get the software... then this program is exactly what you are looking for!

But every time I tried it, I had trouble with the component download. When you want to use a special feature it says it needs to download a component, then the download freezes or takes forever. They just don't seem to be able to fix this or put enough bandwidth on their site. I've had this problem with different computers, providers and OSes, so it's not just my configuration. I've had no problem downloading anything else. So eventually, I'd give up on Photoimpact due to their awful component download even though I like it better than other graphics programs. In fact, I just went to the ulead site to try it one more time, and sure enough the darn site doesn't load. I've got a high speed connection and everything else is loading quickly. I'm still waiting on ulead as I write this. I guess they just don't want to pay for decent commercial bandwidth, which is a real shame since it's a top product."

One example: the documentation index lists an Object Extraction Wizard and refers the reader to page 25.  On page 25, an Object Extraction Wizard is listed as one of the program's features, but there's no information there (or anywhere else in the documentation that I can find) about where it is or how to access it.  More frustrating, the instructions in the documation all begin by referring the reader to one of the seven or eight panels or toolbars on the user interface, but none of those toolbars or panels is labelled on screen, and the names they've been given in the documentation are so generic as to be indistinquisable; the net effect is that before you can begin to follow the instructions, you first have to come to a full stop, while you search the documation for the location of the panel or toolbar being referred to.  Numerous other frustrations emerge after you manage to find the correct panel or toolbar--why should the burn or dodge tool be hidden within an eliminate red-eye icon?--but I'll just finish by saying that this is not remotely a modern or logical or user-friendly interface."
600257,A9Z5L0JFXKIU2,0,1,1,B0002Z45D6,12/20/2004,2,5,5,"For beginners and those with simple requirements, only","Ulead's CD & DVD PictureShow Deluxe Version 3 is a cosmetic improvement over Version 2.  PictureShow 3 features a new simplified, straightforward interface; adds Pan and Zoom motion effects, a nice set of matched visual and audio (instrumental) themes, and the ability to drop clipart on top of one's pictures. PictureShow 3's new interface divides the program into three distinct parts: 1) Organize; 2) Theme; and 3) Burn.  In the Organize section, users select pictures for and arrange the order of the pictures in the slideshow.  In the Theme section, users select one of thirty themes, which consist of a matched menu and audio soundtrack, in which to present their slideshow.  The Burn section is where users may put their VCD, SVCD, or DVD slideshow on disc. The 30 themes, divided across six categories (Fantasyland, General, Holiday, Special Events, Sports, and Vacations), make it very easy for a mainstream user new to photo slideshows to create a good-looking slideshow in a very short time.  Ulead also provides a free download on their website of 43 menu templates taken from PictureShow version 2, that enables users to load and edit their PictureShow 2 slideshows in PictureShow 3.  These templates, however, do not include matching audio soundtracks. PictureShow 3 retains two major weaknesses from its predecessor: * It is very difficult to use more than one music piece for a slideshow soundtrack. * It is also very difficult to synchronize a slideshow's duration to its audio soundtrack's duration -- that is, to end the slideshow and its music at the same time. In the PictureShow program, unless otherwise manually specified by the user, a music piece will repeat itself until the end of the slideshow.  This may not be noticeable for instrumental compositions, but it is quite conspicuous for any vocalized song.  To use more than one music piece, the user must preview the slideshow to determine the slide where the current music piece ends, and then manually insert the next piece of music at the next slide. The new ""Match slideshow to audio duration"" function seems to work only if the soundtrack consists of a single piece of music longer than the slideshow duration.  In other words, the function is quite useless.  For all other instances, ending the slideshow and its music at the same time must be done through painstakingly manual trial-and-error.  The user must manually calculate the total duration of the audio soundtrack, and then adjust the per-slide duration of the slideshow accordingly. Consumers new to photo slideshows and with simple requirements -- i.e., those who are willing to keep their slideshows within the time limit of one music piece, will like Ulead's CD & DVD PictureShow Deluxe 3.  But experienced users and those who have want to have longer slideshows (e.g., for vacation or wedding reception photos) should consider other software first.  Photodex's ProShow, for example, allows the easy use of multiple music pieces in a slideshow soundtrack; and can synchronize a slideshow's length to its soundtrack's length automatically."

To these people I would recommend they contact the person who installed and configured their wireless network, because they'll need the WEP code and SSID (Wireless network name) to connect their camera. Installation was pretty straight forward with the right information about the network.  Signal strength is fine wherever it may roam (more on this later), and while the audio is a little scratchy, it's a bonus feature I'm just tickled to have at all.  Color is OK. Some people have said they have problems accessing it over the Internet after a period of time.  I don't use the camera this way so I can't comment on this.  I should point out that I use the camera in what is probably an unconventional manner.  After I tested it out, and knew it worked well (the other reviews had me nervous), I removed the antennae and hooked up a signal booster (basically a stronger, powered antenna), tossed the AC-DC adapter and replaced it with a battery pack (to make it truly wireless), and connected it to a servo controlled pan/tilt bracket, then screwed the whole thing onto the front of a robot (think Martian rover).  Just for kicks, I plugged in a small set of old speakers to make the audio 2-way.  The audio/video stream can be added to any webpage with some JavaScript code, and with this it can be incorporated into custom control software for any electronic devices (like robots, or pan/tilt brackets) you might have in use with the camera. For really basic features, you don't even need to install the D-Link software, you don't need more than the A/V stream, because all the essential controls are built into the JavaScript (video zoom, audio volumes/mutes, and a PTT button to talk through the speakers).  So once you have the D-Link software installed on one system, config the camera and get everything working, you can access the A/V stream from another computer with minimal fuss."

D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked! 6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid < $80 for an indoor camera. Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work.

It scans OK, except the cards don't eject fully out the back so that if you're scanning a batch of 5 or 10 cards, instead of falling neatly in a pile out the back they jam up on each other, make a big mess, and without constant cleanup, end up interfering with the scanning of the final cards.  If you only scan one card once in a while this may not affect you. The problem is the software.  I got and/or upgraded to version 7.0.5, and it's barely usable.  The card recognition is pretty good in most cases.  However, the connectivity is sadly lacking.  The synchronization with Palm desktop does not work at all with the new versions (4.1.4e or above), so I can't use some new features of the Treos or the desktop software.  Electronic card and calendar entries are still useless to me because I'm bound to an old Palm desktop by the CardScan software.  I can't even sync to Outlook for a PIM because CardScan software 7.0.5 requires it to be the primary MAPI mail program, but even if I set that now, it STILL doesn't work with Outlook.  Even the Palm sync now takes THREE FULL MINUTES of system-jamming CPU time to sync a few cards with the Palm Desktop. To add insult to injury, the arrogant software keeps nagging me to register (even though I've registered two times already) and continuously harasses me to use their questionable, privacy-threatening online backup database. CardScan tech support, while it's commendable that they still take my calls, will NOT upgrade me to version 8 unless I pay the full price $150 for new software which probably still doesn't work right. I've been through several versions of the CardScan software (having used an earlier version of the scanner) and they've NEVER gotten their sync to work properly, but apparently they have no qualms about charging customers more and more money for their frustrating and dysfunctional software.  It takes so long now and is so difficult to scan and transfer cards that I'm back to entering new contacts manually in the Palm Desktop."

600236,A3OC9D29H8WH9M,0,1,6,B0002Z5Y54,12/6/2004,1,8,8,Horrible Case.,"I bought this case only because my local CompUSA had no other cases. First of all, the price is way too high for a single piece of rubber. Second of all, it's very difficult to get on and off, since it's made out of rubber and iPods are made out of metal (a lot of friction). Thirdly, it gets dirty very easily. The screen to protect the iPod's screen isn't made of plastic, but instead rubber (like the rest of the case). It picks up dust and lint very easily and sticks to the iPod's screen. I think that's supposed to be a plus (sticking to the screen), but not all of the air bubbles go away, which creates very annoying shadows on the screen of the iPod. The dust and lint also create more annoying shadows. This case is very bad. Soon, I'm getting a Contour Showcase iPod case. It looks very promising and actually worth the money, unlike this one."
600235,ABTZ76QHUZ4I0,0,1,5,B0002Z5Y54,6/11/2005,1,4,4,HORRIFIC TO YOUR IPOD,"This was the second case I bought. I thought it would be reliable because of the screen protection, ventalation, and silicone rubber. WOW WAS I WRONG!!! The only thing this case could possibly be used for is a duster. It is open at the top of the case so when ever you try to adjust and or take it off dust collects inside and is a pain to get out. Another complaint I have is that is scratches the screen whenever you take it off. I now have a long scratch down the front of my pod. If I were you look at the Contour Showcase it is one of the best cases possible. DO NOT BUY THE JAM JACKET!!!!!!!!"
600234,A2U7CVNUP9F832,0,0,4,B0002Z5Y54,9/9/2005,1,3,3,avoid if possible!,"when i bought my ipod 20gb i knew that the first accessory i'd get for it was a case. now i didn;t do much research on them, so i was just looking for a case that covered my ipod but allowed me to still access the click wheel without removing it constantly. seeing as this was really the only case that met my criteria at best buy, i bought. after using it for a week or two, the cons severely outweigh any possible pros. first off, the case is way too expensive. 20 bucks for a piece of rubber? the sides are nice and allow for a better grip, but most of the time i have the ipod in my pocket so that was useless. the case fits tightly over the ipod, and while this may sound like a nice feature, it sure causes problems putting on the case and removing it. i spent a good twenty minutes forcing my ipod down into the silicone case. which brings me to my next point. if the screen protector is one of the selling points for you, be advised that it is NOT plastic, the entire case is silicone. i didn't think this would be a big problem when i bought the case, but dust, lint and small hairs get easily trapped between the ipods screen and the silicone cover, and its almost impossible to clean without taking the case off (which is nearly impossible in itself). being rubber, the protector sticks to the ipod screen, which can make the screen very difficult to read without constant use of the backlight. one of the very few nice things about this case is that everything is accessible...the click wheel is easily usable, although the case can sometimes get in the way...the headphone jack and hold button aren't blocked at all, and as far as i know you can keep the case on while you have the ipod on a dock. besides that, this is a waste of money. instead, i recommend Agent 18's Clickshield, its all plastic (so it doesn't attract dust), very light and you can take it off easily. do NOT get a silicone case!"
600233,A167343R81RHDD,0,1,3,B0002Z5Y54,3/21/2005,4,3,3,yes it gets dirty but people like it,"I have had this case for almost 2 months now and have no significant complaints.  Yes, the case gets dirty because it is made of silicone and attracts lint.  However, it is quite easy to just take a wet tissue and wipe this dirt off every so often.  As for taking the skin on and off...it is difficult the first two or three times but gets easier to take off the more you use it.  I don't think you are supposed to charge an ipod with a case on, even with the vents on this case, so when charging, take the opportunity to take the case off.  I thought it was too hard at first, but now i find it quite easy.  The screen protection is nice, and after i let the ipod sit, there are no air bubbles on the screen.  Lastly, I've had many kids at my school comment on this case, saying they like it and would like to get one.  My one friend indicated that he really disliked his leather case and wanted to try mine because it looked nice provided lots of protection.  It is not perfect, but if you're not a neat freak this case is worth a try."
600232,A37QTEZY8BJBEP,0,1,2,B0002Z5Y54,8/9/2006,1,1,1,"Look elsewhere, this jacket is a bad investment all around.","There's one thing I love about Apple: their products just work, and it's unfortunate that that same level of quality does not translate over into the 3rd party developers who are responsible for producing many of the accessories available for iPod products. I purchased a 20 GB iPod Photo in the summer of 2005, and, wanting to protect my investment, I put an additional $20 for this jacket. When I got home, I faced my first problem: getting the jacket on. The design is such that you're having to slide your iPod into a space that literally if it were any smaller, it wouldn't fit, against a material that produces a particularly high amount of friction. After about five minutes of wrestling with the thing, I finally got my new iPod (sort of) in. Then, as I booted up my iPod and started using the interface, I noticed the second design flaw. The screen protector is made out of the same material as the rest of the case and isn't entirely transparent to begin with, not to mention it has an awful tendency to attract dust, lint, and all sorts of other things that make it even harder to see through. So, after a few days of accumulating grime, I took the case off to try to wash it, and lo and behold, the inside lining is somewhat grainy and scratched up the screen of my iPod a bit. Result? I'm out $20 with a slightly damaged iPod. An iCleaner Pro Kit and a ClickShield (alternative case) cleared up all of my problems, but not without wasting some money in the long run. This is, simply put, a poorly engineered case, and not worth anyone's money."

I'm not sure if it's compatible with the dock (because I don't have one), but it DOES have a thin silicone cover on the iPod screen! It leaves the top and the area around the port at the bottom uncovered. It's a little difficult to get on, but there isn't really a need to get it back off so that's not an issue.

This one does a great job with them - they can stay plugged in, while the earbuds and cords can be slid into the outer pocket, which is nice and square-edged, not bulky. The case is a quality soft leather, easy to snap open and closed, and the face of the iPod is protected with a hard clear plastic except for the scroll wheel. I love this thing. Also, though it probably wasn't designed for this intentionally, when the front of the case is flipped back, it serves as a prop, so the iPod can stand on a tabletop facing you. These aren't easy to find, but totally great."
600225,A34RT0DXYY6HMC,0,1,2,B0002Z5YOA,12/30/2007,1,0,0,"A nice idea, but the product in the box didn't match the picture!","I was of course thrilled when I first got my U2 iPod Special Edition (the 20GB 4th Gen color version), and having read so many entries declaring how easily these scratch (and the kinds of slip-cases that caused the most/least scratching), I thought this DLO leather portfolio would be great! I was a bit disappointed with what I actually received.  And my fate may not be the same as others, so take that with a grain of salt.  What I got was a case designed for the older 3rd Gen iPods (with the 4 buttons just above the click wheel).  I thought perhaps it was a simple mistake, until I read the package -- even worse!!  DLO had simply 'rebranded/reboxed' this older product as a '4G/3G' iPod case -- probably overstock that they were trying to dump.  Suffice it to say, I didn't feel up to returning it as I feared a replacement DLO product might be the same, and I'd be in the endless amazon loop of return and replace (usually after the third round, they give up and just refund your cash). Anyway, in spite of the annoying misalignment of the footprint, the case nonetheless did a decent job, holding my iPod snuggly and generally protecting it. So why the lame rating?  The one star is for this:  I later got my wife a similar generation iPod (for pretty cheap, as the 5G video had just released, and she couldn't care less about video), so I went looking for a better case, and found one produced by Krusell (the Krusell 75216 Case, also sold on amazon.com).  Well, after seeing a) how much better it fit (designed and branded only for 4G); b) how little scratching the LCD received (no laminate over this portion); and c) the fact that it had a nice little cutout in the bottom (so you can recharge in the case), I pretty much felt gipped, and in fact a little jealous.  ;-) So, it's an ok product, but now that the leather is starting to unravel, I'm trashing it and buying a Krusell.  Hopefully other folks here got the actual pictured product, and maybe were happier with it."

There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized. I get a lot of compliments on it, which is strange considering it's a diaper bag. In fact, a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I'd gotten it, because it was ""exactly the purse she'd been looking for""-- she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag!

And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???

According to my friends, I carry a ridiculously small purse for a mom (I have a 12 y.o. already)--it's really just a cell phone holder with one pocket with slots for cards and another zippered pocket for cash. I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives --after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag. But, at the same time, if my memory serves me well, a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear, etc. on a daily basis even harder. So I was thrilled when I saw this bag. It came in the mail today (from another merchant) and like another poster, I've been trying it out. It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it --a few diapers, change of baby clothing, etc. And so far, it feels very comfortable. Even when worn in tandem with the PreMaxx New Edition baby carrier I also bought. I will post again once the baby arrives to give an update on this product."

It fits most of the essentials to go out for the day to the mall or to run errands.  It even fits my wideneck bottles and wallet.  There is not enough room for change of clothes, changing pad, or toys but that's what the bottom of the stroller is for.  It is very comfortable to wear even over a jacket and does not hurt your back to carry it.  And it's never in the way of maneuvering your way through the aisles."

We also have a really nice (and more expensive) tote, but it is freakin' huge...more appropriate for a day at disneyland or something.  For day-to-day this is all you need.  I must note that I am an exclusively breastfeeding mother and I carry no bottles at all.  I have no idea if I could carry everything I would need...but then again I don't know what you need for formula feeding or storing breastmilk.  Anyhow, I can carry 7 diapers, a cloth diaper to use as a changing pad, and a pack of travel wipes in the main top compartment.  I carry an extra onesie, pair of pants, socks, beanie, small receiving blanket, extra breast pads, and a digital camera in the middle zipper compartment. I carry my wallet and Lansinoh Brand Lanolin in the lower compartment, although I could fit much more.  Along the front I carry 2 pacifiers (only for emergencies), my cell phone, and a pen.  I love the pen pocket because I don't like picking up icky germs using the pens at the supermarket or doctors office to sign credit card receipts.  The only problem I have with this bag is the material along the top of the water bottle holder tore after using it for only 2 weeks! And I can't figure out how to exchange or return it to Amazon because it is outside of its original packaging (duh).  Also, it is a little akward to have on while my baby is in his sling... so usually my husband carries the backpack and I carry baby, or other way around."

Although I was not using it to carry children's gear, I carried an umbrella, 3 bottles of water, granola bars, sun glasses, cellphone, keys, wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great!  I am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag, it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far."

Not only is this bag stylish, its functional as well.  My baby is almost 6 weeks old, and I can still carry all the major necessities that fit in my other diaper bag.  If you get the black & gray model, Dad can use it also! This is what I currently carry in the bag: Bottle Holder - 1 4 oz. Dr. Brown bottle, can definitely fit larger bottles in the future Large Top Compartment - 3 diapers, baby wipes case, and small bottles of hand sanitizer and baby powder, disposable changing pad Middle Compartment - 2 4 oz. Dr. Browns bottles and a formula dispenser Bottom Compartment - Extra Sleeper and Shirt, my wallet, and keys Small Velcro Compartment on Strap - loose coins Cell Phone Compartment - my cell phone of course Small Zipper Compartment - Chapstick and Lipstick - there is also a nifty pen holder next to this compartment"

Why bring what amounts to a piece of luggage on those short trips? This diaper bag is the ULTIMATE in functionality for brief jaunts, holding a truly amazing amount of stuff, but holding it stylishly, to boot. It may look small, but I can carry three or four diapers, a small container of wipes, a change of clothes, a nursing shawl, a burp cloth or two, spare baby socks and a hat, a teething ring or two, a snack, my wallet, keys, Palm pilot, a tube of diaper rash cream, and a few other odds and ends in there with no problem. There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized. I get a lot of compliments on it, which is strange considering it's a diaper bag. In fact, a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I'd gotten it, because it was ""exactly the purse she'd been looking for""-- she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag! It's sporty enough that my husband and 13-y.o. son don't mind carrying it, either. If you're going on a day trip, you'll need something bigger, but for those typical ""quickie"" errands, you can't beat this bag!"

Great for short trips to the store or other short outings. Comfortable and easy to carry especially if you already have your hands full with more than one kid. If we are going somewhere for longer periods of time I do pack a larger bag though so we can fit a change of clothes, blanket, toys, etc."

If I were to go out for a longer trip, I would likely use one of my other bags for the more roomy features.  However, this is perfect for the 1-3 hour trips out. It is also very cool and urban looking.  My husband doesn't mind wearing it.  I have gotten many compliments on it and also from people who had no idea that it was a diaper bag! The one thing that it lacks is a changing pad.  However, I use a receiving blanket to put the baby on instead."

This bag has a big compartment for diapers wipes and maybe achange of clothes two smaller compartments, one for your cell phone (very convenient it's in the front of the bag and another small one for money or change or keys. inside the diaper compartment there is also a zippered pocket and a pocket for a bottle that is by the way insulated. If you are either in a small outing it's great and if you have a bigger baby. I highly recommend it.

The essentials bag fits a blanket for laying the baby on to change, a new outfit, at least two diapers, a wipes case, three 6 oz. bottles, a formula dispenser, my wallet, keys, pacifer, burp cloth, and cell phone.  Everything has it ones compartment, which makes finding everything easy, no digging around in the middle of a big bag, and due to the design it feels much lighter than a larger bag.  I have not had issues with the seams coming apart either.  I also recommend the Bundle Me, by JJ Cole, it makes winter travel with babies so much easier than a snow suit!"

All the separate compartments really keep you organized.  The only problem we had was the stitching on the outer flap of the diaper compartment was too close to the edge and the material starting fraying and essentially falling apart.  I loved the bag so much that I thought I would give it another try and have not had any problems with the new one.  I am hoping that it was just a fluke.

Sometimes my daughters bottles leak and the compartments are not water proof, so everything in the bag would get wet and stained the bag.  When I washed the removeable bottle compartment, it fell apart.  We no longer use the diaper bag.  It wasn't the right size for us, but might be for others."

According to my friends, I carry a ridiculously small purse for a mom (I have a 12 y.o. already)--it's really just a cell phone holder with one pocket with slots for cards and another zippered pocket for cash. I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives --after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag. But, at the same time, if my memory serves me well, a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear, etc. on a daily basis even harder. So I was thrilled when I saw this bag. It came in the mail today (from another merchant) and like another poster, I've been trying it out. It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it --a few diapers, change of baby clothing, etc. And so far, it feels very comfortable. Even when worn in tandem with the PreMaxx New Edition baby carrier I also bought. I will post again once the baby arrives to give an update on this product."

There is not enough room for change of clothes, changing pad, or toys but that's what the bottom of the stroller is for.

We also have a really nice (and more expensive) tote, but it is freakin' huge...more appropriate for a day at disneyland or something.  For day-to-day this is all you need.  I must note that I am an exclusively breastfeeding mother and I carry no bottles at all.  I have no idea if I could carry everything I would need...but then again I don't know what you need for formula feeding or storing breastmilk.  Anyhow, I can carry 7 diapers, a cloth diaper to use as a changing pad, and a pack of travel wipes in the main top compartment.  I carry an extra onesie, pair of pants, socks, beanie, small receiving blanket, extra breast pads, and a digital camera in the middle zipper compartment. I carry my wallet and Lansinoh Brand Lanolin in the lower compartment, although I could fit much more.  Along the front I carry 2 pacifiers (only for emergencies), my cell phone, and a pen.  I love the pen pocket because I don't like picking up icky germs using the pens at the supermarket or doctors office to sign credit card receipts.  The only problem I have with this bag is the material along the top of the water bottle holder tore after using it for only 2 weeks! And I can't figure out how to exchange or return it to Amazon because it is outside of its original packaging (duh).  Also, it is a little akward to have on while my baby is in his sling... so usually my husband carries the backpack and I carry baby, or other way around."

It's not a big deal -- the unit is user friendly and works great, and it still looks nice, but I can't believe that this $300 item already looks worn when it is almost brand new and has been used carefully and moderately.

For the price its a bargain and will ensure Palm's market share stays high. Pro's, 1. Its a Palm, with a stable version of Palm OS. 2. Looks good and feels solid in hand. 3. Superb screen and extremely clear. 4. mp3 playback is very good. 5. Uses standard mini USB jack, not propreitary Palm connector. 6. Fast performance. Don't compare raw MHz between PDA's, this one's faster than 400MHz PPC's. 7. Available memory is a lot for a Palm. 8. Good software bundle and Bluetooth (chear up Sony Ericsson or Powerbook users)! 9. Speaker is - suprisingly - good at playing mp3's (64kpbs sounds great). 10. Camera is better than cell phone ones, 1.2 mega pixel. 11. Stylus is very ergonomic. 12. Silver looks better than blue edition, IMO. Con's, 1. Down button is hard to press, ironically that's the most used button on Zire 72. The 5 way navigator is poorly designed and cheap plastic. 2. Case is slippery (on positive side it looks like the paint won't come off like on the blue edition). 3. Battery life is just slightly better than Pocket PC's, needs charging frequently. 4. Included charger is not a world charger and is bulky. 5. No bluetooth or Wifi but atleast it has SDIO slot. 6. Weak alarm sounds (think this can be fixed?) and no vibrate only mode. 7. Packaging in plastic box is tough to open and not eco-friendly. 8. Battery is not user replaceable. (dead Palm after 2 years? but same with most PDA's) Overall Zire 72s is an excellent device and you can't go wrong with this one. Much more easier to use and reliable (Palm OS) than PPC's. Highly recommended!"

The PDA starts up instantly, more quickly than my old Dell Axim, and is overall very quick and responsive and easy to navigate for calendaring and contacts.  Games play very smoothly, and the display is crisp and bright under most lighting conditions.  The camera and video recording capabilities are fun and entertaining extras that are handy for the occasional spontaneous and candid snapshots of my friends.  And I purchased the Tom Tom Bluetooth Navigation kit, which transforms it into a very effective navigation system for my car.  The voice recorder, which isn't even available on the flagship Tungsten T5 is very useful too - I can easily capture lectures, meeting minutes, everything right onto the 512MB SD memory card I use with my Zire.  Its truly a definitive 'digital assistant' in every sense of the term.  Very good buy - I highly recommend it."

This noise has rendered it very annoying to use. I have to turn it off after seconds.  I then found out this is a common problem described all over the web for Palms with high res screens. I have called Palm, and the technician admits it is defective. I demanded an exchange, and they wanted to charge me $40 for an ""expedited exchange"". It's either that or I can send my unit in for repair and wait weeks. ""Sorry, company policy"" he said. Some in the web suggest overclocking programs to fix the problem. I've tried these and no matter what setting I've tried, the noise DOES NOT go away.  Only the pitch changes somewhat. Hours wasted. If you have this problem CALL PALM AND DEMAND A FIX!! They are well aware of this problem and sell these defective products anyway. THEY HAVE TO HEAR FROM THEIR UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS, and maybe they would finally do something. Zire 72 otherwise performs as expected.  It would otherwise get a 4 star from me."

(no kidding) -dont forget the zire has infa-red built in to it.  are you like me and ever go to the electronics store and in the home theatre section look at all of those nice expensive fancy remotes for like hundreds of dollars?  whell, the zire 72 is WAY better than any of those (i own one)- you can buy a program and teach it commands from old remotes, or get them off the internet or database.  i always have my remote on me at all times for the entire house.  very cool. -there are also many map and gps programs available in which you can load maps of your city on your palm. i calculate shortest routes and never get lost anymore. it works without gps, but you can get a wireless bluetooth gps receiver for it which makes it even better.  must have for the zire 72. -also, if you have a big enough memory card and enough patience, you can fit full-length, high definition movies on your zire that play smooth, fast, and clear.  movies in your car, what more can i say?.... -if youre a student, you can buy a program that turns the zire 72 into a scientific graphing calculator (in HD!!)  different skins, unlimited things you can do- i spent a couple hundres bucks on a graphing calculator for school that is half as good. AND THE LIST GOES ON!!!.... no problems, small light, amazing resolution and color, and all that good stuff... get this now!  there arent enough stars to say how useful the zire 72s is to me.  until i break it or lose it one day, i will always have it in my pocket."

It requires charging continuously, because you lose all of your data if it goes to zero charge. The battery indicator will lie to you.  I downloaded a battery info program to backup the on-board battery indicator and that lied to me as well. There is no way to shut off the backlight, so that is a constant drain on the battery. I bought a WI-FI card, and saw the battery drain to less than 50% in about 15 minutes, so unlimited web surfing is out of the question. Other little things add up to a big pain in my A--! No cradle.  The camera shots are really out of focus in low to mid-level lighting (needs a flash, but that would kill the battery also).  The case has no belt carrying capability. The slot for the expansion card (SD) is too deeply recessed, so you really have to push the card in deep for it to lock.  If you have really big fingers, you might have to resort to using you fingernail to push it in. I probably wouldn't be so harsh with my review if it lasted a bit longer, so I could have gotten my money's worth.  Well, maybe Palm will fix it quick.  (Is that asking too much?)"
600132,A2EUZMIHWTJD6X,0,0,47,B0002ZAEYA,3/5/2005,5,14,14,Solid performer,"I've been using the Zire 72 for about a month, and have found it to be a solid performer for the price.  I use it to keep track of everything from grocery lists to business information, and play MP3s and hi-res games frequently.  The unit does all of those things well.  It also works well as an alarm clock (it can wake me up from a dead sleep), event reminder, and any number of other things. Overall, it has exceeded my expectations (which were pretty high), and I would recommend it to others.  Here are some things you might want to consider when purchasing the Zire 72: * The 320x320 screen is beautiful and bright, and displays photos, games, and e-books quite well. * Nice sound quality on MP3s when using headphones (requires memory card for MP3 storage), and transfers MP3s quickly from my computer using the included RealPlayer software. * The built-in digital camera is nice, but it doesn't function well in low light. Don't expect great photo quality in general, but it's good for on-the-go picture taking. The number of pictures you can store on the Palm is limited to the amount of free built-in memory you have available. You'll have to move them to a memory card or a computer periodically, should you use this feature. * The stylus is lightweight plastic, and it tends to fall out of my Palm frequently. It's good to have extras on hand. * The memory card slot is recessed and somewhat difficult to access, but it also means I'm not accidentally ejecting it on a regular basis like I did with my i705. * It has a non-replaceable battery (it's built-in, so when it eventually dies, so goes your Palm) which holds a decent charge, but drains somewhat quickly when listening to MP3s. * It comes packaged with a basic soft case that doesn't flip open with no memory card holder, and the Zire itself doesn't have any sort cover, so you'll likely want to buy a separate hard case. * It won't work with any cradle(s) you may have, since it doesn't use the universal connector. It comes with a USB cable and no cradle. That was a bit of a disappointment, since I already have two cradles sitting around the house I can no longer use. While the lack of a cradle (with separate cords for power and HotSyncing) can be annoying, it's also useful to me to use the Zire at my desk or on the couch with it plugged in to the power cord so I don't have to worry about draining the battery. I have a few things left to test (taking and playing video, using Bluetooth), but I didn't buy the unit for those features and haven't been in a rush to try them.  I haven't had the unit long, I can't speak to performance over time.  And, of course, since I haven't had any hardware issues, I can't speak to Palm's customer service and technical support. I've had positive experiences in the past, but that was a few years ago. If you're looking for a quality handheld which gets the job done and has some nice extras to boot, give this one a go."
600131,A2ZYWA7MDZ6UZB,0,1,46,B0002ZAEYA,6/30/2005,4,17,18,Expandable yet limited by day-to-day battery life,"This device is great, but the life of the battery is ridiculous. GOOD:   With the appropriate additional applications (free or for a bit of $$)  and the extra memory and wifi cards, it allows you to listen to music, download and read to you books on tape (http://gutenberg.net.au/, thru a computer voice), get your RSS news feeds to read on the bus, connect and check email as well as surf the web on certain wireless networks (can't do it at Panera for some reason).  I've been able to expand its functionality beyond what I originally expected. Of course with all this added software (about 3 additional applications) there are occasional times when I need to do a soft reset (data remains).  Not a big deal. The only COMPLAINT I have is that the battery doesn't last longer - I need to charge it at least every other day - even with minimal use (not even using the wifi), and if the charge in the battery goes down to zero, you lose all your data, something my Palm Vx never did to me.  All that you haven't backed up recently, and the device resets after charging. So if you're good at charging your devices contintinually, you'll be fine.  I've lost data several times because I'm traveling and the thing dies quicker than I expect it to. Oh yeah, and Palm doesn't sell an after-market charger that allows you to have chargers in two locations, at home and at the office.  But you can trickle-charge it over your laptop if it's connected to a AC outlet, using a USB connector. A bit of an inconvenience, if you're relying on your data to be there when you need it."

Buy the silver and you will have a 5 star Palm. The audio recorder produces excellent quality and the camera, while not so great, is nice to have on occasion. All and all, it is a great little Palm, and as for the blue paint--I sanded it off so I now have a silver Zire 72. Careful though, it is easy to go through the silver paint to the copper underneath."
600129,A1K8EOUQAH7IBW,0,0,44,B0002ZAEYA,11/9/2005,4,12,12,I love it except...,"Within a few days of purchasing it the speaker went out and I had to return it to Amazon who quickly refunded me. But (there's always a but), in the meantime, Palm discontinued it because of the TX and I am not a happy camper. Although the TX is great with its big screen and Wi-Fi, I wanted the 72s because of the silver color and the camera, which also captures video. In fact I did a small video of my pug puppy brushing his teeth and I was thrilled. My pug was acting cute and I was near my bag where I had the Palm, so I just got it out of the bag, turned it on and started recording. Super-easy and convenient. Although I think it would be nice to have Wi Fi in such a small device, I don't care much for it in this case because I already have a laptop. And although the camera is not the greatest digital camera, it is handy to have with you at all times (and I already have a superb digital SLR--the Nikon D70, so I don't need a second great camera). The sound on the speakers is not that great, but it works really well with headphones. The voice recorder is also nice to have. I had no major problems with the Grafitti 2 and for the harder characters, it was easy to access the keyboard. I find it odd that the version of Documents to Go did not include MS PowerPoint, just MS Word and MS Excel, but I am not planning on doing any presentations on it so it does not really matter. I think if I had a choice, I would rather have better money management software than Documents to Go. I would love it if it came with the Splash Wallet Suite by Handmark. Anyway, big mistake to discontinue this one! Luckily I found an online store that still carried one brand new and just placed an order. I hope this one won't have a deffect."
600128,A1HITNPFV7ON7L,0,1,43,B0002ZAEYA,10/27/2005,4,12,12,Pretty decent product but some major flaws,"I bought this unit because I am an interpreter/translator, and instead of luggin around all of my dictionaries and reference books, I wanted to be able to buy ebooks and download them onto the Zire 72. I bought the unit new for $250, plus a 512MB card and a card reader for the PC. We are talking around $300 just to get started. I have spent another $100 - $150 in ebooks and games (like Madden '06, bejeweled, dopewars, etc.) So my overall investment in the Zire 72 is around $450. I have had the machine for about 3 months now and I'll give my pros and cons list: PROS: Good color, You can put photos if you want as the background or use some color schemes that come with the Zire. Easy downloading things to use on the palm, easy to Hot Sync the machine with my PC. Easy to learn. Helpful software included in the packaging. Easy to personalize. Takes decent photos and video, not great quality, but not too shabby Voice memos and handwritten notes are easy to use can make playlists on the MP3 player and you can shuffle the songs up CONS: Once in a while when I turn on the Zire 72 half of the screen is blanked out. I have to reset the entire machine, if I turn it off and then back on the lines are still there. Once in a while it does freeze up, and you have to reset it. So far this hasn't been a huge problem, just a minor inconvenience. Sucks for taking QUALITY photos, but if that is what you want, better buy a digital camera. The fotos do come out better than I thought they would, but it depends too on what you are using your palm for. Video recording and playback are fine, unless it is loud music you are recording. You cant manipulate the microphone, can you? in some applications you have to use a down arrow that is poorly situated and often hard to see to scroll through material, sometimes you end up hitting the hot sync button instead. music playback through headphones gives me a tinny sound, but just thorugh the normal speaker it sounds okay all in all I do recommend the ZIRE 72 , but I am weary as to how long it will last me. It has come in very handy in my work, and I am glad I bought it"

Applications are very easy to install and most of all easy to sync between PC computers. However, my husband had trouble when trying to sync between the Zire 72 and the mac. He had none of the pop up menus I did, installation was not as smooth and trying to sync his Zire 72 with iCal and Outlook created a big mess. He needed to download the isync from Apple and use that in conjunction with Hotsync from Palm. In short, its great for PC users... but its definately not ""plug and play"" for mac users who need to sync their information with a PC."

I gave the 71 to my mother now I have no PDA.  The first Zire 72 was defective so I exchanged it.  The second one was defective so I returned it and purchased another one from a local store.  The third one was defective so I exchanged it.  The fourth one will be returned today.  The technical representative with Palm said that if I purchase through them then I can get technical support.  I thought that was provided even if purchased from a third party vendor.  Maybe they don't give you accurate answers unless you buy directly from them.  Unfortunately I purchased all of the necessary accessories for it which I can't return because the case is customized ( also expensive).  Since the 71 was so reliable I thought the 72 would be also. This product has great reviews.  Maybe those individuals purchased all of the good ones.  I'm extremely disappointed and that's putting it mildly.

As a college student, I find that this is the PERFECT PDA, minus a couple minor things. The Bad: 1. No built-in wireless, although you can purchase a wireless card separately from Palm (or $20 cheaper from Amazon!).  Just ordered mine, so I haven't tested it yet.  For me, wireless is crucial. 2. Bluetooth is pretty much useless if you don't have a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone.  Supposedly, you can connect it to a PC with Bluetooth and use a couple of features, but I can't get this to work. 3. Battery goes dead in a couple of years.  I hear it is this way with nearly all PDAs, though. 4. Palm doesn't make a very good effort to inform the buyer that you would need to purchase an expansion card to use the camera, video recorder, and MP3 player. 5. With the necessary expansion card and the wireless card, tack on another $150-$200 to the price of the Palm. 6. Battery life is so-so overall, and below average when using the video recorder and/or MP3 player.  However, this is to be expected. The Good: 1. Has virtually every feature I could dream of wanting (camera, MP3 player, video recorder, etc.).  All features are of suberb quality! 2. Great lightweight design and has a big enough color screen. 3. Applications such as Documents-To-Go, where you can view, edit, and create documents from Excel, Word, etc. 4. Great OS!  I haven't even had to do a hard reset once since I purchased this Palm, nor have I experienced any glitches.  I use my Palm every day. 5. Built-in Bluetooth--if you have a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone or have other Bluetooth-enabled products, this could be very useful. 6. Very comparable base price, although once you tack on the necessities (or what I believe to be the crucial necessities), you're looking at another $150-$200. I would highly recommend the Zire 72, but I've heard the Special Edition recommended much more over the blue edition since the paint chips off quickly on the blue one.  As a college student, this is perfect for me.  When I get my wireless card, I'll be able to get on AOL messenger during class :)  If you're looking to spend a little more, check out PalmOne's new PDA, the LifeDrive."

Excellent audio features. Why buy an iPod when, for a similar sum, you can have a mini-computer with digital camera, mp3 player, voice recorder, bluetooth, etc. The bad: 1 - Should spend some extra 50$ in memory to store video and a good number of mp3... 2 - Need to recharge battery every 2 to 3 days."

The battery life is terrible.  After only 10 to 12 months of occaisional use, the battery in my Zire will not hold a charge for more than 10 to 20 minutes, and PalmOne wants $125 (plus shipping)to replace it.  The blue paint began flaking off within days after I bought it.  I just scraped it all off with my fingernail and the rough, brushed steel look was OK."

It does everything I need a PDA to do... It keeps track of appointments, expenses, my contacts,  notes etc... it keeps me organized... Part of the reason I bought the Zire 72 was for the camera. I thought it would be a nice extra to have something to take snapshots with. I wasn't expecting much as far as picture quality goes but I can get some pretty decent prints out of it. The video camera feature is fun to use but don't expect a great or even good quality clip. The battery keeps a decent charge, the bluetooth works great and there are many freeware and shareware titles to download off the net.  The Zire 72 was a great buy for me."
600120,A27SY6UFNHR5O6,0,0,35,B0002ZAEYA,10/14/2005,5,7,7,i love it!,"This is my first PDA. I've been using a Sharp memomasters and casio organizers for a long time. I'll be honest with you, the camera is not great. But it is not meant to be. You want a camera, go buy a Kodak. The Camera is just for fun shoots, spur of the moment things that you did not plan for. I went to the library to do some research on plants. Well the librarian gave me a stack of material to go through. It was late and I was not about to photo copy all that. I quickly looked through the pages for the intersting stuff and photographed them with my Z72s. I visited a friend of mine and as we were talking, I remembered how much I really loved this person, so I pulled out my Z72s and snapped a picture. (I don't live next door so going for the 3MP kodak was not an option, not to mention my mood would have changed) The Sound is great Screen is excellent although it started the awful whining noise. Moving around the PDA is very fast and quick. Having used the memomasters and other electronic organisers I was accustom to the instant on, which some PPC devices don't have. I was amazed at the speed of the Palm OS. It does not have back ground applications except the audio player. But that is great, cause on a 3 inch screen. I can only work on one thing at a time, and besides that; half of the crashing on PPC devices is because the background applications don't actually close. Device runs out of RAM and bang. Hard reset! So my opionion. Go get one!"

The different language programs to read different types of languages has not caught up with it. Nonetheless its good with letters. However, mine stopped recharging after the initial charge to start using it. Apparently it can often be damaging to carry it too close to certain kinds of cell phones. I don't undertand since it has a blue tooth function, what do they expect? Anyways I CALLLED PALM, and they wanted to CHARGE ME $40 TO ""EXCHANGE"" it with a new one, which I do not think is fair at all. I recommend purchasing some sort of insurance that would cover it so that you don't get ripped of by the ""EXCHANGE"" costs of replacing it."

The screen bright and the colors are nice and clear. The speaker is loud enough to be heard clearly at an arms lenth away.  It probably could be heard even better if you were in a completely quiet room. Probably the best feature is the notes with alarm.  Nothing beats scribbling a quick note and then having an alarm go off to show you what you wrote."

I'd like a better stylus Screen makes a faint buzzing sound Cons: Well, the OS does some quirky ""background"" stuff when alarms are set or when the auto-off-and-lock feature is activated, etc. Background image disappears when reset is performed Seems like I have to reset more often than I did with my IIIxe; but that might be some 3rd party stuff I have installed All in all, I've loved it.

I always have a camera with me now when one of my three children does something I don't want to miss!  I can record my voice as I am teaching my students podcasting.  I use the calendar and address book extensively and use the blue tooth to synchronize wirelessly with my computer.  I've downloaded some cool games as well as list pro which I love and am using to keep track of all of my Christmas gifts. This is really very handy and you won't beat it for the price!  I do have to plug it in every night and have bought a wireless keyboard with it.
600115,A13BLZ3PBU9N8O,0,1,30,B0002ZAEYA,12/24/2005,4,8,9,"Not a gadget geek, but I like it!","I got this for myself after getting tired of mowing through batteries with my Palm M100/105 (which I adore and still works great aven after something like 7 years) and trying (without much success) to find a replacement HotSync cable after the one that came with the PDA got lost. I am not a high powered executive who lives out a briefcase and I'm not a gadget geek who can rattle off the specs for every piece of technology I own and upgrades every 2 months to something new.  I haven't tried a lot of different PDAs so if you're looking for comparisons this isn't your review.  I like this PDA and am happy with PalmOne's OS and the new applications they've added to the software bundle.  Of course, after coming from the M100/105 which wasn't even color and barely backlit at all, I'm thrilled to have a color screen with good resolution that I can read easily in the dark. Yay! I think the camera takes excellent pictures and I've found the ""fuzzy"" images are more from the camera being hand-held (and moving ever-so-slightly while taking the shot) rather than from what I would call a ""low-end digital camera"".  Stop whining, it's a PDA after all - I didn't buy it because I wanted a top-of-the-line digital camera, but it's handy to have one. I took great pictures with it but simply setting it down on my picnic table and aiming it at the kids and that seemed to really help and I noticed a big difference in the image quality. I got the Special Edition which is silver and I love the silver color and to be honest, the blue color of the regular Zire 72 was a BIG turn-off.  My old M100/105 actually had snap-on face plates and I had numerous different colors like metallic orange (my favorite), a pretty light blue, red, purple, green, yellow, snakeskin print and a lovely rich woodgrain one that looked very sophisticated. I think Palm had a GOOD thing going with the snap-on face plates and really miss being able to change the color of my PDA case to match my purse or my phone (or my MOOD!) but find the color screen a good trade-off. The old M100/105 also had a built-in (but removable) flap that covered the screen area and so I never really had to hunt down a good case to cover the sensitive screen area. The flap wasn't as protective as a case, but it was there! So, out of the two PDAs I've owned there were things that I really liked with the old one that I miss with the new one (can't customize the color of the case and no flap) and of course I adore the improved utility of the new one (color screen, brightly backlit display and built in camera). I would really like to see Palm go back to the snap-on face plates. I haven't used the MP3 player or video features yet since it requires an extra memory card and I haven't found it a justifiable expense as of yet. I did get Bejeweled for it (help! I'm addicted) and found the sound quality of the music/game sounds to be about what I expected from a speaker that small. I don't have headphones for it yet either but I hope that the sound quality improves or I'll be very disappointed to hear my MP3s sound like that. I am a little annoyed that I spent all that time learning the Graffiti writing just to have them go and change it (Graffiti II). I can't even select which version I would like to use and really wish that the option was there for us loyal Palmies who've had one since the M100/105s came out (that was so long ago they don't even sell replacement HotSync cables anymore!!). Over all, I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I am sure that there's a bigger and better PDA out there that someone with higher standards would love as much as I love this Zire 72 and are willing to pay a lot for it, but for my purposes and for the price this was right on."

One would expect a better, crome stylus like Tungsten handhelds. Also earbuds and expansion cards are sold seperately (then why advertise that it can play MP3's), I do not think it would add much cost to palm to make these standard. Comes with only 32 mb memory, which is not sufficient. Palm does not even include the screen protector sheets with Zire 72s. The blue version gives you ""Palm bucks"" which silver version does not."

That costs one star! Overall, I would definitely recommend this PDA to anyone interested in buying a new one.  It's FAST, the color 320x320 screen is awesome -- very crisp text on this brilliantly lit color screen!  I have yet to try the mp3 side of the handheld.  That really isn't something important to me, though for many it is, and I have read reviews that say the sound quality is quite poor.

I still have to purchase an expansion card and so far the prices seem reasonable on those.  I have not yet utilized all the capacities for this device, but if I had, I'm sure it would receive 5/5.

To my surprise, none of the new models have the video and camera that the Zire has.  I suppose it's Palm's way of pushing you towards buying a Treo -- but I don't like the phone/Palm combo, so I went for another Zire.  I have to admit I paid more for this one because it's silver and soooooo pretty -- much nicer than the standard blue I had before -- but I'll just count that as the cost of being a girl. :o)"

I looked at others and found they lack some feature that the Zire 72 has like a built in speaker, camera or voice recorder. The Good: - Documents to Go: love this, I have read long docs on the plane when I had nothing else to do (while listening to music on the MP3 player) - Voice Recorder: missing in many PDAs,  Handy when driving and you need to take a note - Built in speaker: Not great, but beats having to plug in earphones to hear your voice memos or check audio - MP3 player: I use it for music and audio books - Video Media player: I work in video production and have demo reel on my palm now.  How cool is that! - Camera: Ok, not great quality, but has been good for documenting things and location scouts - Great color screen: I had a mono Palm VII before - SD slot: Great for storing tons of MP3 files The bad: - Can't replace battery yourself:  The one thing I hate about this little gem.  I'll look into self fixes on-line - No Wi-fi built in: but you can add it with a SD card. I've added a keyboard and have written scripts and artilces with my Zire. Scott"
600107,AZ0SIZRQWN7RC,0,0,22,B0002ZAEYA,11/12/2006,3,1,1,Great expectations,"I enjoy using the Zire 72 and understand compleely why it's such a popular and successful model; at the aame time, I understand why Palm pulled it from their line-up. It has a lot to do wtih user expectations. When you use a PDA, you assume that its individual features will run easily. While the vast majority do, and very well, the Zire 72 loses points in the ""bells and whistles"" department - just the area  where it's touted as being so unique. 1. Although the Zire 72 boasts a digital camera, the grainy image and poor white balance makes a good cell phone's images look considerably more appealing. Do not expect the camera feature to function as you'd hope. 2. Everybody raves, and rightfully, over the wonderful color screen, which is easily bright enough to read and work by. Eyestrain is unlikely. But it comes at a cost - an unuually fast loss of chorge. While you can plan for it by charging often and carrying a cord, it's a danger with longer periods of use. 3. The Media Player is, like the digital camera, useless. It requires the installation of expensive memory chips, and saps fuel at a frightful rate. You're best staying with your iPod instead of using tbe Zire's player. 4.  Battery replacement is a challenge. There are online options for learning how to replace the battery, but it's not for beginners, and you stand to break your PDA. Some feel you're safest paying the extra money to have a pro do it for you. I use and enjoy my Zire 72, and hope you don't take this as an unnecessarily one-sided review. Rather, it's meant as a means to put the PDA into perspective. As long as you know which features you'll be able to use (and which you won't), you'll be able to make a much more intelligent consumer decision."

This one should have a shrine built if it ever dies. SYNCING, Use Avantgo free service for all news, sports, magazines like CNET, PCWorld, RollingStone, Yahoo, Bloomberg, Seattle PI and much more. Syncs addresses and calendar using Outlook as its main database. Patience can be a bonus; When putting videos on it, it can take up to 15 minutes or more. Music is a bit faster, Real takes care of all that. CAMERA is very low quality, washed out, poor resolution, poor definition of edges, blurred. Hard to shoot a good one, but sometimes (rarely) it does okay. Expect to do a lot of touch up when you download the pics onto your pc.  Videos are washed out, sound quality okay, distorts badly with high volume, like an idling hotrod at 20' sounds like pure static. BUT the camera is very handy if you left your digital camera at home. i.e. car accidents. VOICENOTES hangs computer when syncing, i don't use VN anymore. REALPLAYER works great, sound quality is excellent on sony earbuds. Have 150+ songs, 60+ pics and 30+ vids on 1MB SD card w/360MB still free. MEDIAPLAYER Works great, just drop videos onto the desktop converter and into the palm they go. Longest video i have on it is about 10 minutes. WIFI would be nice but that's available in a different model. Maybe a card coming. SOFTWARE is a little disjointed, would like the databases and calendar to tie together better. It could benefit from a lot more automation. Calendar is invaluable, haven't missed a birthday, anniversary or important biz meeting yet. Contacts uses Outlook as its server. WINDOWS APPS Documents-To-Go makes it completely win compatible. FREEZES & CRASHES Probably 10x in 2 years, up and running in seconds after a reset. Far fewer problems than my buddy's $500 win handheld. He often must redock to reload all his software and contacts. A huge problem when you're not near your pc, totally cut him off one time, no contact info. See Quirks below. AGE & BATTERY May be pushing 2 yrs old, battery life is down to about 5 days off the charger. DURABILITY No glass screen to break like the old V series. Bounced off cement floor from shirtpocket more times than can remember. Screen covers are a must. Keep forgetting to remove from pocket while sandblasting, powerwashing, walking to work on rainy days. Sand once wedged sd card inside, pulled it out with needle nose pliers, surprised it still works. Power washed entire side of building with it in pocket, set it in the sun to dry it out, still works fine. (it dripped when held on end) Often gets rained on when walking to work, set it on pc monitor to dry it. Puppy chewed it once, after repeated freezes, hangs, weird buttons being pressed during setup (when i didn't press them), figured out the front cover teeth marks were pushing hard enough on the touchscreen that the palm thought I was pressing entries. BLUETOOTH, works as advertised. Setup was a little goofy, but got it done. QUIRKS Watch out for crumbs, crud and dirt (and teethmarks) between the screen and the front fascia, crud will press on the touchscreen and cause all kinds of weird startup & freeze problems. I will buy another one when this one dies."

At first, I did not have a need for it, so I tucked it away until the time was right. I was laid off in August 2008, and I returned to college as planned. A year later, I found myself employed (yeah!)and taking three courses. So the need for this device finally arrived. I charged it up only to discover that it wouldn't work. Because I knew it's capabilities and being short on cash, I was depressed when I had to purchase another PalmOne PDA. So I invested in a refurbished Palm m515, and it was a waste of my time! After venting for hours about the m515, I picked up my Zire72s, said a prayer and plugged the charger in it. I hit the reset button again- and it came on!!! I have NEVER appreciated an electronic device in a my life until now. After all these years, it continues to keep me satisfied. If you are considering purchasing this item, you made the right decision. Keep in mind that it was released about 7 years ago, so the 1.2 MegaPixel camera may be outdated, but it continues to do a great job. The device has withstood the test of times in my various bags/cases (with and without it being in the PalmOne case), so the durability is excellent! Just when I began to develop an itch to purchase the Sony eReader, I discovered that I can also read Ebooks on this device. How cool is that? I was going to invest in a Blackberry this evening, but all that changed now that my Zire 72s is back up and running. I could not see myself paying an extra $30 per month for the Blackberry, so you can imagine how thankful I am right now. This is one electronic device I will never take for granted again."

It sticks to the pocket lining and I was specifically avoiding the listings for the blue version.  Also, the seller included the wrong stylus and it's difficult to put in and take out of the groove.

As an added benifit you can feel good about yourself as others pass by with their high dollar iPods like a herd of sheared sheep!

527136,A1GZ9GH5XTGNV0,0,0,10,B000ETVKHE,7/16/2006,1,8,22,mark my words: THIS THING IS [...],"I recently bought this sansa at Best Buy, and I very much regret the purchase. I was just goint to Best Buy because I was looking into buying some sort of MP3 player (not necessarily an ipod because they are a lot more expensive than other brands) to hold about 4 GB of music. When telling this to one of the employees, she pretty much talked me into buying a Sansa e260. She definitely had very good reasons for getting a sansa over an ipod nanos: sansa's are a lot cheaper for the same amount of storage capacity, sansa's are more durable than nanos, sansa's have an FM tuner included and nanos don't...the list goes on and on. A big deal for getting an mp3 player was being able to charge it on the go because I'm going on a lot of trips this year and I'm not always gonna have access to a computer. Even though Sandisk does not make a charger specifically made for the Sansa, the employee at Best buy assured me that I could buy a Griffin brand wall charger made for an ipod and it would charge it. I guess I made a mistake on my part howeve because I bought the sansa with the wall charger in the beginning of July, right before leaving on vacation. After charging the sansa right when I got it, it stayed charged all week (to avoid having to charge it all the time, I set the backlight on dim and had it turn off after 5 seconds) into my vacation. After a couple days of long car rides, my sansa needed to be charged so I plugged it in correctly to my wall charger and left it to charge overnight. Unfortunately, nothing happened and my mp3 died. I coulnd't get it to turn on or do anything the rest of the trip. I even went to walmart during my vacation to try a new charger to see if it was just the charger but it failed to charge with it. This is when I knew that this thing was a piece of crap and I was disappointed because I had no music for the rest of my vacation. Pros - *long battery charge if you don't always leave the backlight on *FM tuner *good sound when using good ear phones (more about that in the cons) *easy to load music onto using my already organized music library on window's media player *very durable and fit well in my hand *easy to get around (I liked how all of the menus were organized) Cons - *wouldn't charge with a wall charger!!! (although, when reading some of the reviews on here, I guess a wall charger worked for them) *adding songs to the ""Go List"" is annoying because you have to play each song you want to add individually *the ear phones that come with them have horrible sound and don't fit in my ears. Also, the little foam things that cover the ear phones fall off so easily. It's too bad though because I really liked my sansa and how it worked overall. I'm getting an ipod nano soon though because I'm done dealing with crap. Now I know why ipods are more expensive. It's also nice how you actually can find all of the accessories you need for ipod anywhere."

528304,A1N8OBUE89TAM,0,1,3,B000EPAP1U,1/8/2009,4,0,0,Great value,"Prior to buying this product, we were using 2 different wireless phone systems so we its a pain to transfer calls, maintain phone numbers, caller IDs, etc. We needed to replace it with one phone system that can accommodate at least 4 handsets so 2 years ago we bought the Uniden DCT646-4 expandable wireless set.  Here are my thoughts on this phone: * Setup was not quick as each handset needs to be configured but it was relatively smooth and straightforward.  Once you know how to configure one handset, the rest are mechanical. * I have had handsets with better call quality but also had some that are worse, so this phone is probably average when it comes to call quality.  Its clear enough for me and the person on the other line so it works. * Each handset can be identified by name so I thought that was a nice feature.  If I needed somebody, I know which handset to call/page to get to the right person or room. * The voicemail button setup can be a bit cumbersome when you change providers and voice mail access numbers (like we did) as each handset needs to be configured.  I don't know how many people have different voice mails for the same line but this should have been one global (propagating to all handsets) setup or at least an option to have it configured as such. * The caller ID is useful to screen out callers but unfortunately there is no way to just ignore the call and stop the ringing for all handsets all at once.  You can press ""End"" on one handset but only that one stops ringing.  The rest will keep on ringing until the voicemail system takes over.  This was especially irritating when our youngest was still a baby and we forgot to take the handset out of the room he's sleeping in or when there are visitors in the house.  There should be one button to just ignore the call and send it to the voicemail. All in all, there are things I would want improved on this system but for the price and features this Uniden system is a great value."
528301,AAO5HSYB23WW9,0,0,46,B000EPLRFI,6/2/2006,5,84,87,I love it,"I love it. It is not perfect, but it is close. The black looks great. It is not shiny, but matte. It is not painted on, but infused in poly-whatever material used to make the case. It is durable and buffs clean from fingerprints when needed. The magsafe connector is great. I have damaged other laptops from tripping over the power cord, no more with magsafe. I also love the lack of a latch, as magnets hold the laptop closed--a nice touch. It gets a bit warm, but honestly it doesn't bother me. I prefer that the fans are as quite as they are. It is a trade off, cool computer=loud computer. I prefer a bit warmer and whisper quiet as the MacBook is. What else can I say? It is super fast, it runs OS X and Windows, it has a beautiful screen, and it feels great in my hand, and works perfectly. I can make DVDs that play on my lousy cheap DVD player hooked to my TV (that my PC can't seem to). I think the huge track pad is great. You can use two fingers to scroll thru documents and use two fingers instead of one to right-click. Yes, a Mac laptop that can right click--finally. The only complaint is the speakers are small and not very loud for some things. Without headphones, hearing sound when watching DVDs is hard, since DVDs have a wide sound range, so the lower volume sound, like dialog can be difficult to hear whereas the music and explosions are easier. Even if I turn it up full volume, I cannot hear everything. To make this better, I downloaded the free VLC player for DVDs and media, as it allows me to boost the gain with an equalizer, and be able to hear dialog. iTunes also has an equalizer, so boosting the gain is fine in that program. Upshot, speakers small, not perfect, if a problem, use headphones or software that adds an equalizer. If you want to save money, buy the white one, it is a better deal, and some prefer how it looks. I like the black, so I paid the extra money. Newegg has memory for it, and its cheaper than Apple's by far, and this MacBook is super easy to upgrade memory to 2 gig. I highly recommend more memory if you are a power user. Overall, I love it."
528300,A2W248L4J2M647,0,0,45,B000EPLRFI,6/1/2006,4,61,69,One of the best bang for your money,"I would rate this 4.5, but there is no option. I do not feel that it deserves 5.0 either due to a few issues. Well, overall impression is very good. Great looking as most Apple's  products. 1""thick and has decent small factor for road warrior. Performance: It is about 2-3 times faster than my old 12.1 G4PB depending on what you run. Everything is very snappy and OS Tiger and iLife'06 work flawlessly. One of the best OS yet. I recommend to reinstall the system. I get around 5GB back by eliminating those programs, etc. that I do not need. Otherwise, it takes around 17GB for complete installation. Quite a lot as it comes straight from factory, me think. Features: Well, here is what MacBook really shines. It comes with all you would ever need at the best price package. Look at specs yourselves and you will understand what I am saying. I would recommend getting aftermarket memory stick (1GB costs around under $90). Even upgrade to 1.25GB, it is really worth it. Unlike old small iBook, MacBook aftermarket do-it-yourselves upgrade is a breeze whether memory or harddisk. What is hot: 1. Built-in iSight is pretty good. Better than my expectation. 2. Very nice responsive keyboard and trackpad. You might need to adjust your trackpad response per your personal preference. 3. Keyboard at first look seems unusual, but after a few hours, it think that it does stand out from usual crowd. 4. Nice wireless iDVD remote. 5. Subtle glossy screen, delivers awesome picture quality, while dose not produce too much glare while you are outdoor. 6. Magsafe is one great addition. Very well thought out and design indeed. What is not: 1. Heat is way beyond my liking. However, it is only at top left of the laptop bottom, where you connect power supply (Magsafe). It is not just warm at that spot, it is blistering hot. This is very imminent when using AC regardless of power setting. While on battery at battery saver mode, it does cool down and only gets warm. I highly suggest that you get cooling pad to max out longevity of your precious lappy. 2. Small lappy factor is not that great. Well it is a tad lighter than MBP by about 0.4lb. 5.2lb is pushing for most true road warriors. Considering many other goodies you will be carrying in your bag. The old small Mac lappies weigh around 4.2-4.6lb only. Bottomline: If you want the hottest lappy in the market now, go get it. If you think that you can wait, you might want to wait toward the end of the year. I am being hopeful to see MBP in 12 or 13"" or Apple improves heat problem for all their new laptops. Well, MBP heat issue is known since the release until today."
528289,A3F35R77OSWTLL,0,1,34,B000EPLRFI,10/19/2006,4,7,7,I love Apple,"I got my mac in the month of May, soon after apple released this grt machine into the market. Its really nice right from fast 2GHz intel duo processor from finshing - good looking black. I like mac very much,but the problem is majority of technical software were designed to run on windows. Here I got the solution. I use mac for general web browsing and switch over to windows (on the same laptop ) to work on technical software.........really grt........nothing to loose. You can experience the real power of the processor when use advance computing software........... probably get surprised at the first time. One thing I have to mention is apple customer care. I got the problem with my macbook after a couple of months. The technician at apple store said there is a problem with MLB of my macbook and sent it to reapir. (Since Iam still under warraty its free of charge.) After one week i got it back and when I turned on ............................................... Oh....... again the same problem. (I dont know what the guys did after keeping it for one week.  but the report says they changed the MLB) I rushed to apple store on  the same day.  WITHOUT ANY THINKING, THERE THE MANGER OFFERED ME  TO GET IT EXCHANGED WITH NEW MACBOOK. And now Iam using that new one that seems alright to me.  And it is great thing that apple  cares for customers than anything else!!!!!!!!!!! One thing I would like to mention is the battery time. the apple website says upon full charge you  get upto 6 hours. In practice it never happens and can you imagine how much time you get the battery when you are using it for regular netsurfing?...........................................Belive me its  typically around 2 hrs!! If you need to work off the power for long time than macbook may not perform upto your expectations. Other wise everything is good and is worth for your money."
528243,A3HAOIT3XS3TIL,0,1,16,B000EQKXFM,5/12/2006,4,30,30,Pleasantly surprised!,"I received the iHome iH5 for Christmas, but returned it because one of the speakers buzzed.  I didn't replace it because of reports of this problem recurring.  I decided I didn't need an FM/AM Radio w/ iPod dock after all.  Until I ran across the TEAC GR-10i at Costco.  I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a tray after receiving a coupon. At first, I was worried about its larger size, but I find that its size probably contributets to its bigger sound - far superior to the iHome; probably on par with speakers that cost 2 to 3 times as much.  I just can't believe this unit produces such rich (with deep bass) sound.  The AM and FM reception is also very good - I can receive all my favorites quite clearly, where usually I have to settle for half of them (with static!).  And it comes with a seemingly sturdy remote (weighs twice as much as you'd expect, and the material feel strong). My only complaints are its size, the gray color, and lack of battery backup (power failures >30 sec resets everything, according to the manual).  Its performance ranks a 5; its cosmetics and lack of a few features ranks a 4.  Other problems for other folks are the lack of a full complement of alarm clock features (such as snooze!) and docking plates for the newest iPods (video and nano). Bottom line is if you want great AM/FM reception and the ability to listen your iPod through the dedicated port (or any other source via its aux input located in the front), then this is hands-down the winner (certainly over the iHome)."

We applied about 3 coats of this product (it goes on easily with the applicator bottle it comes with). The first coat was splotchy because the vinyl soaked up the stuff. Then, by the 2nd and 3rd coat, it was becoming more of an even coat. Whalaa, I cannot believe the difference. I will try to post before and after pictures. It has made a huge difference in how the vehicle looks, and now we will see how it holds up over time. We had enough to do three coats around all four wheels. There seems to be enough in the bottle to repeat another treatment if necessary in the future. I would recommend this product."
528220,A1FMDVOJBAISVM,0,1,8,B000EQXY1C,5/17/2006,2,71,72,Developer take note: can't produce real blueprints!,"I have long been a fan of 3D Home Architect and have used my old version to design a dozen units of housing, usually on my own but with a professional architect's assistance on a few. This month I sat down to redesign my kitchen and, seeing that the copyright date on my old software (version 3) was 1999, was inspired to try out the newly released 3D HDS8.  My experience with the new product has been frustrating, disappointing, and time-consuming. I feel sympathy for the software developers:  they have clearly worked very hard to add a lot of features, and have increased the ""power"" of this tool to enable the user to make it ""do what I mean"".  To their credit, the limitations of version 3 have pretty much been eliminated:  if you have the patience you can model virtually any 3D object within the design space.  However, their marketing bosses have castrated the end result:  sure it's fun to play with a eunuch, but what's the point if it can't generate offspring? It seems that this product has been demoted from top-of-the-line to a second tier.  It seems that if you want the fully-enabled progeny of this software development team, you will have to fork over $600 for a big-brother product that is marketed through different channels under a different name.  My sympathy for the developers:  their reputation will be dependent on consumer reaction to this mainstream product. The good news: what you get with this product is essentially a designer's ""video game"" that allows you to create beautiful on-screen images.  There are a number of ways to render your product on screen, most of which were present in version 3 but there are some extensions to these features that make version 8 superior. The bad news:  once you've taken the time to create a perfect on-screen rendition of your project (a major time sink, it's as addicting as a video game--with every feature including the kitchen sink thrown in, the temptation to add detail is irresistable), there is no way to ""create blueprint-style plans to print or email"" as promised on the product's box.  Also, code bloat has slowed everything down: version 3 worked well on a Pentium 600MHz with 256Mb, version 8 requires a computer that hasn't been invented yet. Two of my favorite features of version 3 have been ripped out:  the ability to darken wall lines when printing, and the ability to view horizontal cross sections in 3D view (the latter is replaced by a whiz-bang but useless 2D vertical section view).  This product gives you no printing options whatsoever; all you can do is print whatever's on the screen in 150, 300 or 600 dpi. Without the ability to print, I can't use this product to communicate anything other than fancy 3D pictures of the interior. Unfortunately, I can't revert to version 3 either:  there is no import/export utility for data files.  So I will have to find another program for future products, this one isn't what I was hoping for. Developers, take note:  in version 9, PLEASE add real blueprint printing capability.  I need to take these drawings down to the city building department once in a while.  The ones I got in version 3 were amateurish but serviceable.  Version 8 cannot be used to generate drawings, period."

With the hundred dollar plus rebates on the hardware, as well as substantial discounts on the service, I thought I'd break down and give it a try.  Here' my experience... The Good... 1. Very intuitive user interface for the set-up screens and remote; it could be argued that Tivo is the gold standard for ease of use 2. Very secure packaging of unit 3. Included cabling is of unusally high quality (not Monster cable grade, but still very good for included cabling) 4. Installation directions are very easy to follow (though not as good as Dell's color coded design) 5. There is a 30 day money back guarantee 6. Customer reps are friendly and well trained (and they speak english too!) The Bad... 1. The front of the box says all required cables are included; the directions state that a second A/V cable -- required for the recommended installation method -- is ""user provided"" (i.e., sold separately) 2. The service is not compatible with some VoIP services 3. Though set-up is easy, it is a one to two hour ordeal, requiring multiple visits to websites and countless button presses to ensure interoperablity with the cable box 4. The remote is pretty low tech looking; it also has a lower quality feel tha leads me to belive that I'll be shopping for a replacement in a year or less The Ugly... 1. They try to get you to sign up for a three year, pre-paid service contract; if after 30 days you find that you don't like/need Tivo, you forteit all that money -- ouch! 2. When I attempted to use the website to activate the service, the site was unstable and wouldn't allow me to complete the order.  I then called the 800 number for service, where the hold time exceed 25 minutes.  Hope I never have cause to call again as this is a totally unacceptable wait time Net/net: this is a well thought out product that does just what it says it does -- enables consumers to watch TV on their terms."

I'm not a jewelry type of guy, but TiVo is drop-dead freakin' awesome, speechlessly amazing! If you don't know TiVo: plug it in, let it set itself up, and every time you turn on your set, it quietly records as you watch, so if you get up to take a call or get a snack, no problem: TiVo's got you covered. Watch ""The Dead Zone?"" Take a 20 minute break and let TiVo start taping for you: you'll zip through what you don't want and back up to what you want to see again. No tape, no picture loss. TiVo starts with a 15 second or so guide over your picture of what's on that show, how long and whatever else you need to know; not even ""Today Show"" is immune from TiVo knowing what's coming up. If you think there's nothing good on, use TiVo to search it all out. Cut your cable back to basic, bud; you'll have more finds with a lot less, guaranteed. Program what you want to copy via the net. Yahoo! support for photos and junk. Fandango ticket purchases, movie previews, it will even learn, if you want it to, what you like to watch. Very, very easy to hook up although working it into my LCD TV has yet to figure out what hook up is best, although we rewired it and the picture dramatically improved, so thanks Tivo for showing me a few options that were better! I do NOT use TiVo's alphabetical directory of shows: slow. I DO use Yahoo! TV guides to just click and pick: fast and easy as pie. My eMac still can't use TiVo's desktop app, but one'a these days I'll get it working. Slide shows: better than I thought I'd ever use. Love it! Check out the newest features and tutorials; you'll just flip and keep flipping. Recommended: Sign up for the 3-year plan and f'get about it. By the time it's paid up, the next generation of Tivo will be around. It is a safe bet. Anybody who trash-talks TiVo doesn't know it, so tune out critics and tune in devotees and never, ever miss a good show again."
528203,A33LOZG92D4T8Q,0,1,132,B000ER5G58,6/5/2007,3,8,8,Disappointing functionality for digital cable subscribers,"I have been a Tivo fan for several years and recently upgraded to the dual tuner version.  Unfortunately, Tivo's idea of ""dual tuner"" is really only designed for use with basic cable.  I have digital cable, but I can also just watch the analog signal on TVs with no cable box.  In my area, the basic cable signal is weak and has some static so I prefer to watch the digital signal, but I expect to be able to record either.  The way Tivo implemented the channel changing, is that it always switches to the analog cable signal and won't even let you pick the digital signal unless you specifically tell it that you don't receive the channel on the analog source.  However if you do that, you are down to a single tuner, because it won't allow it to record that channel while you are watching any other. I hate to say it, but this Tivo is a real disappointment."

I toyed with the idea of buying a TiVo for a while and then I finally bit the bullet and did. Holy smokes! This is great. Easy to set up. I have mine connected with the coax in and S video out to my TV set. The TiVo service (if you own the box, like I do) is only $12.95 with a one year minimum. It's worth it. They give you the option to pay outright for 1,2, or 3 years in advance or do the month to month thing. I bought the wireless USB network card (no data drops in my bedroom) and even with a 19% signal strength to the wireless router in my basement on the other side of my house the channel lineup download only took about 10 minutes."
528013,A3IVN2U8TYSIDX,0,0,81,B000ET5W6E,8/23/2006,5,78,78,Excellent - very happy,"After reading reviews here I hesitated but happened to see the same machine (but without duplex capability) at a work site and that clinched it for me. This machine is FAST. Setup is easy (I used the network connection) and the software is vastly improved over the last Brother laser I had (an HL-1270N). The ticking noises other reviews mention is very slight and lasts just a few seconds while it heats up. Previous lasers I've had would typically whir loudly during this warm-up time - not this one. I sit next to the printer and it's really nothing. I think people have noticed it because it occurs in silence without other whiring sounds. The noise of the paper pick up (which is typical of any laser printer) is louder than the ticking (heating) sounds and the ticking stops before the first page comes out (so it lasts mere seconds). 5 seconds ticking, 5 seconds whiring and printing, page comes out. Followed by maybe 20-30 very small ticks over the next few minutes as it cools down. In comparison, my QMS color laser whirs loudly for about 15 minutes after printing a page. What I didn't appreciate before ordering is that even the scanner has duplexing capability - fantastic! Double sided faxes and scans are simple. Scanning works well both from the printer and when controlled from the PC. From the printer it shows the list of the available networked PC names to scan to - very nice. Pick your machine, press start, job done. The only slight quirk I've noticed so far is that when sending double sided faxes the reverse sides are transmitted upside down. Maybe there's a setting for this somewhere. I haven't needed to read the manual AT ALL so far. I haven't seen any sign of flickering room lights or other concerns from the power draw during heat-up. Installation couldn't have been simpler. Machine is not too heavy and is easily picked up and moved by one person. OCR software works very well - again an improvement on the past. Verdict (after owning a few days): Don't hesistate to buy - so far very very happy. Vast improvement over previous MFC's and lasers I've owned."
528012,A5USJPCARNHW9,0,1,80,B000ET5W6E,4/27/2006,5,51,51,Great Multi-Function Machine,"Having had bad experiences with multi-function machines in the past, I over-researched this purchase.  To begin with, this machine's specs are top notch for the money.  You simply cannot get this much bang for your buck from any other company.  Taking the machine out of the box and setting it up was remarkably easy.  I actually thought I was forgeting something.  The software installed cleanly and is user-friendly.  I should mention, however, that I have not gone through the fax machine setup (not using for that purpose at the present time).  Also, the machine does not come with a USB cable, which is, unfortunately, fairly standard with printers today. Prints and copies at 30 ppm in 600 dpi.  I have tested this and it appears fairly close to true (maybe a little slower, like 28 ppm).  It produces nice, crisp clear letters in both print and copy modes.  The 50 page ADF is made from a reasonably sturdy plastic.  At least it doesn't feel like it is going to come loose or break off, and I have not had any paper jams (as of yet) in the ADF or standard, 250 count paper tray. The scan function has worked well.  Two very nice features this model provides are scan to pdf file and scan to OCR.  The scan to pdf file is a rare option in a desktop multi-function machine at this price.  It works well, although I am still playing around with the settings in an effort to find the best scan quality at a decent file size.  I think the pdf file sizes I have been getting are too large (around 700KB - 1MB for a 1 to 2 page pdf).  Surely this can be corrected by changing some settings.  The scan to OCR also works remarkably well.  I can remember 5 years ago attempting to use scan to OCR on another machine and being very disappointed.  Things have improved greatly. The cost of the toner cartridges on this model are reasonable.  A high yield 7000 page cartridge for around $80 - $90 works out to a cost per page of 1.14 - 1.28 cents per page of toner, which is quite good. Can't comment on the fax functions b/c I am not using it for that purpose. Overall, a very nice machine with impressive features at this price.  Hopefully it holds up."

527930,A36XRGX51WTMWS,0,0,804,B000ETVKHE,4/22/2006,5,523,534,A Solid alternative to Ipod Nano,"This player is really well thought out. I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about an Ipod nano. The included software is complete and works flawlessly. Best of all, it will play WMA music files, has an included FM radio, has an expansion slot, and plays home videos. Here's what I've learned so far: 1. MUSIC- You can drag and drop from windows explorer or you can use Windows Media Player 10. Your choice. Either way works great. Note: The installation CD does not include WMP 10 but no big deal. 2. PHOTOS- The included media app on the install CD is a wonder to behold. It couldn't be easier to use and is rock solid stable. Photos shot horizontally are cropped (like widescreen) but photos that are vertical are shown full screen. I am going to experiment on this but haven't had time just yet since I just bought the Sansa. 3. VIDEO- Probably the best feature. The same media app that you use for photos also doubles for videos. Again, unlike some other players that have problems with converting video, this is heaven sent. Just pick out a video and press convert. It converts and then transfers in one step. It works perfectly. Unlike past Sansa's you have to spend extra for a decent carrying case. Still, if you like felt pouches and lanyards (I Don't), they come included. One minor drawback is that you can only charge using the USB attached to the computer. An AC adapter would have been nice. One final note. I tried to convert 2 DVD movies that were already on my hard drive. They were in the 550-700mb range. Each time, the video utility started to convert them no problem. However, in each case the utility timed out after 13 minutes 39 seconds. It cancelled the whole thing so not to worry about having 1/2 a movie on your sansa. I am going to fool around with this and see if I can shrink the file size of those 2 movies to around 200-300mb and try again. If I can work around this and am sucessful I'll let you know. Even though trying to watch a feature length movie on a 1.8 inch screen might be a bit much, the screen itself is really crystal clear (better than nano) and TFT not STN. I would highly recommend this player to anyone. Finally, a company that got everything right and it all comes right out of the box."
527925,A22YLSO32ELPCZ,0,0,799,B000ETVKHE,8/18/2006,5,63,65,"Tried it, love it!!!","Some of the reviews I read left me wondering if this was the right player for me.  I found a consumer review on-line where they ran through the features and actually demonstrated how the thing works.  That did it for me.  After that, I knew that I had to have it. I haven't had to be concerned with the technical issues, as it has done everything except convert video clips that I have taken with my camera.  I found some other software that will convert it and allow me to load it onto the player. Here's why I gave it a five: 1. Voice recording - I use the voice recording to record meetings at work.  The sound is crystal clear, better than any tape recorder I have used in the past.  Also, using the lanyard and dropping it down the front of my shirt, nobody else realizes that the meetings are being recorded.  It's a great opportunity for black mail! 2. I was looking for something that would allow me to record radio broadcasts - I've tried it with music and it sounds every bit as good as the station did the first time.  I mostly use it for talk radio and it works great.  Radio reception is awesome.  I record the radio at work in an office setting.  Reception is even passable in the elevator! 3. MP3s - I am very pleased here.  I was worried that play-lists would be a problem and that having the player randomly select music would also be a problem.  That was based on other reviews that I saw here.  I am sorry, but those people must be idiots.  You can upload the music using Windows Media Player, dragging and dropping play-lists.  The player keeps the play-list and automatically groups your music.  You can select the play-list and it will shuffle just that play-list (if you activate the shuffle function).  You can also play music by song, album, artist, and genre.  Or you can play them all.  It's all very simple and works well. 4. Pictures - I am a photo-nut.  I love to take pictures of my kids, landscapes, and sunsets.  The photos are pretty small, but the detail that the screen allows makes the images very sharp.  You can definitely fit more pictures in here than you ever could in your wallet.  The photos are all converted to *.bmp files using the software that came with the player, but it is very easy to add photos.  You have to rotate all of your photos so they are taller rather than wider to maximize the size of the image on the screen, but it is not difficult at all. 5. Memory - I have uploaded 100s of songs, a handful of short video clips and commercials I found online, 147 photos, and a handful of recordings.   I have used just over half of the memory on this thing. Here are things that I wish you could do with it: 1. Switch out the battery - sure you can, but you need to buy another special battery and I have not seen an external charger.  This is a relatively minor thing.  It will last a full day (from sunrise past sunset) and recharges in about an hour.  It has not been a big drawback for me. 2. Delete songs directly off the player without hooking up to your computer - I ended up with a number of albums of my daughter's intermingled with my music and had to keep fast-forwarding over those songs.  They were mixed in with my work music, so I had to tolerate it for a full day.  Again, not a huge issue. 3. Despite the fact that I have been very careful with the player, it does have some small scratches on its front, one of them on the display.  I can't imagine that this isn't a problem with other players too.  Again, it's not the end of the world. Things that I was surprised by: 1. There's a record button on the side.  That makes it easy to record radio programs when you are taken away from listening unexpectedly. 2. Play-lists are easy to create. 3. It is easy to set the player to shuffle and/or repeat 4. The size is really much smaller than it appears in photos 5. The sound quality when recording (voice and radio) 6. You can reset the player by merely holding down the power button for about a minute.  I did have it lock up on me when I was getting ready to record a meeting, but figured that out just in time. All and all, I would say this is a wonderful player and would (and have) highly recommended it to my friends.  I hope this helps sway you to make the purchase.  I was having second thoughts when I read some of these reviews, but those must have been posted by idiots.  Sorry, but it's true."
527923,A260LRVLP22BYA,0,0,797,B000ETVKHE,5/22/2006,5,30,30,Excellent MP3 player,"OK I will admit I am not a huge Apple fan. I was looking for anything but an IPOD. I searched and read reviews for 3 months about all the different players available. A friend bought a Nano for Christmas and I was impressed but like I said I am not an Apple fan. So finally I had just decided to give in and buy a Nano. I had given up trying to find a better alternative or even one that was close. But to my surprise I read a last minute review of the SanDisk Sansa e260. It sounded great but would it really compare? Believe me, it does!!! It offers more than I ever would have guessed. It comes with a built in FM tuner so you don't have extra attachments and costs associated with it. I don't know how much I will use it but it is a nice ""free"" feature. The audio player is excellent and has 8 preset EQ's. The video is great and also the Pics but I bought it primarily as an MP3 player. The screen is amazingly clear and bright. Much better than the Nano. That brings me to the real selling point for me. You can use the included software to manage your music or you can use Windows Media Player but the beautiful this about this player is you can connect to your PC\Laptop as a usb drive. Since I already have about 20 GB of music on my Laptop converted and normalized. All I have to do is drag and drop the music I want to Sansa drive and media folder. The transfer for a standard CD is about 10 seconds. So far I haven't found anything that didn't play on the Sansa. The other two big selling points for me are a removable\replacable battery and an memory expansion slot. Both are long overdue by other manufacturers. The Sansa takes a about 4 seconds to load but it isn't an issue for me especially when it help preserve battery life. This is a great alternative to the IPOD. In someways, it is superior. Battery life (compared with my pals Nano), screen clarity, Expansion slot, USB drive mode, Built in Voice recorder and FM tuner. All this and $50 less than the comparable IPOD Nano."
527897,A1RB7QE77EWX6M,0,0,771,B000ETVKHE,6/5/2007,3,7,7,Not great for listening to audio books,"I use my Sansa e260 for listening to Overdrive Audiobooks downloaded from the library.  It is way too easy to lose your place in a book with this device. If you forget to lock the controls and you bump the record button on the left side of the device--you've lost your place.  If you connect to your PC to charge the device or download another book, you've lost your place.  If you accidentally push the center control to the left or the right, you've gone to the beginning of this section or to the beginning of the next section and lost your place. I've gotten into the habit of looking to see what section I'm on frequently so I have a clue when I have to start searching for my place. Also, on 3 occasions since January, I've gotten the message ""Synchronize to continue music subscription.""  The book I was listening to wouldn't play at all. This didn't have anything to do with the book checkout period expiring. The SanDisk help desk people had me reformat the memory and re-transfer the file.  It was the same file, but it worked after reformatting.  Don't see how that could be a problem with the file, but that's what the SanDisk people were saying. It happened on especially long books, like ""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell."" I recommend getting the Macally SN-A411 USB AC charger so you can recharge without losing your place in your audio book.  I'm on my second charger (replaced by Macally) as the first one quit working after 3 months.  The only cost to me was shipping the old one back to them. Pros: It's more reliable than audio tapes or CDs.  It is very small and light.  It's just not perfect."

It integrates easily Windows XP and I load most files to it using Windows Explorer. The Sansa firmware utility updated the unit just fine, just plug the unit into the USB port and it happens automatically. Charging of the battery is very slow using the USB port it works much better either with a car or AC charger. Sound quality is very good and as long as you volume level your MP3's before loading them into the Sansa the db levels are constant. Navigation is a snap with the wheel and the other controls, very easy to learn. Overall I am completely satisfied with this product."
527893,A3827OGYO6Z67K,0,1,767,B000ETVKHE,3/2/2007,4,7,7,Definitely A Worthy iPod Nano Competitor,"I had been using an iRiver h10 for a little under a year and it died a horrible firmware death that was unrepairable, so I got this unit as its replacement. Let's clear up one thing up front:  THIS UNIT DOES NOT SUPPORT MP3's ABOVE 256KBPS.  SanDisk does not acknowledge this or post this as a part of the product, but their tech support will admit it if you call them about it.  The 256kbps cap isn't  asuggestion -- the unit will choke and stutter badly on anything higher bitrate.  So just know that ahead of time that you'll have to convert your MP3's down to 256kbps at least before you can use them on it, and plan accoridngly.  For me it was an annoying oversight (especially since my old iRiver H10 happily played 320kbps files), but not a really big deal because with a half-hour of work I could convert my 320kbps files down to 256kbps and transfer them over for use. All that aside, it's a great little player with a very nice display for its size and value.  The sound is good, controls and UI are solid, and the battery life is fanatstic (2 more hours batt. life than a Nano).  Its 4GB of storage is a solid capacity and value. The playlist plays through a number randomize function, which is a GOOD thing.  Each song is assigned a number, and when a randome number is chosen the corresponding song plays.  This is nice for one reason -- if you change the contents of the drive while it's paused, the device won't choke when it tries to resume a file that's no longer there.  Instead it will play whatever file has that same number now, or skip ahead to a new number if that number simply no longer exists.  It's a very small thing in the grand scheme of things, but a big annoyance that it prevents and I've seen other players not be abel to handle such a simple scenario. One other downside I found was the media conversion tool to import photos and video (since this unit plays video).  On the video side it unfortunately converts to QuickTime, which is IMHO an absolutely terrible video format that results in bloated movie size on the device (80 MB video files become ~160 MB after conversion).  However it converted over my little DivX movies with almost no hitch.  And the screen is small for video, but not entirely unwatchable.  I personally still find it more novelty than useful though, but it deifnitely works as well as it can. On top of it all, it also offers MicroSD expansion, and a rather nice FM Tuner -- neither of which an iPod can boast. So if you don't want to be an iSheep, and you don't need iTunes or similar music management software to help manage your device and are happy with Windows Explorer copy-n-paste to move your media on, this really is a very nice little player for its price.  I have to say I enjoy it a lot and would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone specifically trying to avoid Apple's iPod empire.  IMHO it not only matches them, but beats them in many areas."

Before buying it I have read several reviews on Internet, most of them say that it has nice featurs and a good sound quality. So, I bought it and found that its sound quality is not as good as I expected. By the way I am comparing sansa with iPod nano. At some instances I hear hissing sound in some songs which sounds great in my car audio system. I may have to see if there any setting which can improve the sound quality. I like some of the features like loading mp3s from computer. You dont have to go through format change, you can simply drag and drop as in Windows Explorer, FM radio is fairly good and ability to store and display color pictures. It is not better than iPod for sure. iPod has a nice sound and touch pad navigation, in sensa navigation is done by wheel. The height of this wheel is little more than it should be, which makes harder to press the buttons around it. Overall I found it little better than average mp3 player."

Portability - it travels well and is surprisingly durable, a necessity for me Ease of use - At first, I got confused by a couple of the menus but, after a couple of minutes, I was able to navigate through with no problems.  I can port my files onto the player without having to use special software - another big point for me.  My only gripe is with the ear buds as they never fit right in my ears, but that's hardly Sandisk's fault.  I'll simply purchase something a little more flexible and smaller. Price - after doing a comparison, I found this to be the best value for my money. All in all, enjoyable so far."

Also I like the fact that it had a SD expansion slot. This was my first Mp3 player. It was easy to use. Not complicated at all. I did alot of shopping around before I bought it and I know I got the best deal for my money. If you are looking for a good MP3 player with alot of features for the money then this player is for you."
527123,A304AY9M0FAI3Y,0,1,95,B000EUCMWK,10/6/2006,5,26,26,A great little player,"The SanDisk Sansa c140 is much smaller and easier to carry than a CD/MP3 player, and that is a plus for traveling. Several reviews below gave a low rating to the player's sound fidelity, but it sounds clear and rich to me on voice or music.  My main for purpose for using it  is voice Podcasts.  I have been using my player for about three weeks. There are two volume levels in the Settings.  The highest volume in the default or low setting is not very high.  This means any background noise can easily overshadow what is playing.  Changing to the higher level is a distinct help when walking along the street or listening on an airliner. Several previous reviewers also complained about short battery life.  The AAA alkaline battery that came with the unit gave out before its listed time, but it may have been weak from sitting on a shelf.  The battery meter in the display does not give any reliable clue as to when the battery will fail.  Always carry a spare battery with you, especially if you are using rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise, it seems to be a great little unit and I am looking forward to getting a lot of use from it. The player is easy to use without installing the factory software.  As long as ""MTP"" shows on the screen when connected by cable to the computer, just drag and drop files.  It does not matter if files are in a folder or not.  The player finds and plays them in alphabetical order.  If properly shut down, it remembers where you stopped and begins there the next time the player is used.  It will even save your place during a reasonably quick battery change.  When a battery fails, the player starts again at the beginning of the file playing when the battery failed. The PDF manual on the software disc is far more detailed than the printed quick start guide and is worth reading soon after your purchase. It is not difficult to navigate the menu, but a little practice makes use of the controls much easier.  The FM radio feature is nice to have. The voice recorder works well.  Files are stored in the Record folder in the unit's memory.  You are supposed to be able to play them on the player, but I had to move them to my computer first.  The files appear with a WAV extension on the player, but appear on the computer as MP3 files.    The microphone does not produce a loud recording and must be held close to the mouth, making it easy to get a lisp on the recording. The player will not accept an external memory card, but with 1 GB of internal memory, it is large enough to hold an entire MP3 audio Bible."
527118,AU0DW3JBI1JRV,0,0,90,B000EUCMWK,9/24/2006,4,7,7,Good product for use and price,"I bought this player for my dad so he could retire the CD player when jogging and traveling.  While I prefer the iRiver series, I chose this line for a few reasons: 1.  Buttons were larger and easier to maneuver. 2.  Music and radio functionality were available. 3.  Storage size is a good size to have enough variety of music. 4.  Price was more than reasonable. 5.  The unit runs on a battery so a battery change would only be necessary versus charging it. In addition, I learned that this unit could carry photos and videos.  While unlikely to ever be used, it's there as an option. Like other SanDisk products, this item does deliver on what it advertises to be.  The instructions for how to upload music is a bit confusing, but solved with the following:  I opened the unit as though it were a regular flash drive.  Thereafter, I opened the ""Media"" folder and clicked and dragged the music I wanted into the folder.  Simple enough. The sound quality is fine (i.e., equalizer options) and the bright color screen allows for easy reading.  In addition, there is the option to listen to the radio if so desired.  The unit is small, light, and an easy companion for where ever it may go. In the end, I wanted my dad to have something that was easy to use and delivered on quality.  SanDisk does both with the Sansa c140."
527117,AITUQ9W8G238T,0,1,89,B000EUCMWK,8/31/2006,1,7,7,Very unhappy with the quality of this device,"I bought this player for 2 reasons. One, my son had a similar, smaller version that he was very happy with. Second, I wanted a small flash player device that would work with Rhapsody and their Rhapsody to go service. Initially the player performed well. I was syncing about 90 songs which consisted of subscription and MP3s from my own CD collection. After I added a second playlist which was mostly subscription music, the player froze up. At first, I thought I had tried to sync too much music, but I was well under the 1 gig limit at 650 meg. So, I started doing all the usual things to reset the device (pop the battery, hit different control key combinations, etc.). But everytime I turned it on, it froze on the Sandisk screen which is the initial screen. After 1.5 weeks of working with Sandisk support, they decided to have me ship it back and they would send a new unit. The new unit arrived and things worked well for one day then the unit started to stop playing after each song and freeze. Popping the battery would unfreeze this time and I was able to follow technical support instructions by reformatting the device using Windows Media player and resyncing with Rhapsody. After the resync, the device froze again and now I cannot reset. I suspect that the problem has something to do with the Rhapsody service and the ""Play for Sure"" code, but that is only speculation. If I can't get my money back, I will try to get another unit and only sync it with MP3s. If that fails, I will crush it underneath the tires of my car and call it a day."

Was not as straitforward as the other MP3 player I own, the ZEN NANO from Creative.  Songs were alright, although I agree with other reviewers that the menu navigation is cumbersome more than helpful. Major gripes started about 5 days in: (1) Audible books were able to be loaded on, but quit playing after about halfway into the first book.  Others could be seen and selected on the player, but even with volume set at high and all the way up, can barely hear the voice.  Multiple attempts to work around (using different media players or loading on directly) were unsuccessful.  Which brings me to problem #2: (2) Sandisk telephone and email support people were totally unhelpful.  After several suggestions that I either already tried/considered or were off base to begin with, they blamed others-- ""it must be an Audible problem or the file is messed up"".  Neither are true, as both continue to work fine on computer and the other MP3 player. (3) Now it is stuck on one of the Audible programs, but will not play, not shut off (unless I take the battery out), will not respond to anything.  So now it is worthless. I will never buy a Sandisk MP3 player again."

This is a very user-friendly MP3 player, probably a good start for first timer.  I plugged the MP3 player into my computer with the included USB cable, found the player on My Computer, and quickly deleted all of the preloaded songs, since none of them were of any interest to me.  I drag and dropped files from My Music folder, and within minutes was ready to listen! The player runs off of one battery (included) and the battery lasted me about a day and a half, but that was because I left the player running all night (I forgot to turn it off!) the first night I bought it.  Since then, I've listened to the player every day at work, 8 hours a day, I haven't had to change the battery in 4 days.  Battery life seems to be pretty decent, especially since AAA batteries are not that expensive. I have yet to fill the player, and so far I have 198 songs loaded (MP3 files, about 3-4 minutes in legnth).  I know if the files are WMA files, the player will hold double the songs.  There is also an FM radio on the player, which is a nice addition. I have yet to experience any glitches with the player.  It plays my songs beautifully and the volume is MUCH more than I need, unless I want to rupture my ear drums.  There are two settings to the volume, one louder than the first, and I still have it on the first setting.  I also bought a $7 set of little speakers, and it sounds awesome! The picture viewing capabilty is something I have no explored.  But it seems a tad pointless to me.  The screen is tiny!  I don't think you could even see what the picture was... In conclusion, great player than I recommend!!!  Awesome alternative to the IPOD!"

Some of the issues in other reviews here can be solved by reading the manual. Simply set to MSC mode and the player acts just like a removeable hard drive when connected via USB. Very simple to transfer or delete songs etc. The 2Gb is reasonably good capacity... in fact, great capacity considering the price. The FM radio works fine, although a little trickier to navigate than some older sandisk models. Color screen is good, although a little too small to be practicable to view photos on. The song title can also take a little too long to scroll fully. I had no trouble with sound quality or crackling or clipping at start of song. Sound quality is fine! Battery life also seems good for me. I have even ran some el cheapo batteries with it and had good life up to the stated specs (although this depends on how much you press buttons and have the screen lit up). Voice recorder is handy, although I find I don't use it too much, your mileage may vary though. As a basic MP3 player and radio, I find it hard to beat given the price tag. I have no issues with size of the unit. Sure its not as thin as an Ipod Nano, but it takes one AAA battery which you can get anywhere. No need to have a power point to recharge. I think some people expect perfection for a budget price!"

File transfer and retrieval is quick.  My setup is a laptop hooked up to a docking station, and this unit does something I wasn't expecting: It turns itself on during boot up, and turns off during shutdown.

526758,A3GTU3AY1YLLMS,0,0,78,B000EY1LCI,10/4/2006,5,23,23,Excellent travel day pack for the photo-tourist,"I bought this pack to use primarily when travelling. When I'm on vacation, I don't want to be loaded with so much gear that I'm more caught up in my equipment than my surroundings. However, I still want to be able to carry my Nikon D50; 18-70mm, 10-20mm, speedlight, 90mm macro, perhaps another lens or two, a travel tripod, a jacket, snacks, and still have room to cram in a couple of small souveniers. And while I typically leave the laptop back at the hotel, I want to have it and my camera gear with me on a plane. In addition, it has to be able to carry a fair amount of weight comfortably for a long time and be built to last. Overall, this bag meets all those criterea. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable this bag is when fully loaded. It does not have a hip belt, but the design of bag places most of the weight (the camera gear) at the bottom and near your back (the laptop). The straps are fairly wide and excellently padded and the back pads allow a reasonable amount of airflow and support (thanks to a generously cushioned and contoured lumbar pad). It's sturdy enough for regular use while traveling, but you still want to excercise care handling the bag as all the camera gear sits at the bottom. I wouldn't trust it with the trained gorillas I've watched unload baggage and you don't want to drop it, but otherwise I don't worry about my gear inside it. If possible, I would give the bag 4 1/2 stars; overall, it's a great solution to my needs, but it has a couple of minor short-comings. While it sounds minor, the one that bothers me the most is the single zipper on the main compartment. I really like the double zips on the camera case and laptop portions as they can be left closed in the center for rapid access, but that's not an option for the main compartment. I frequently find myself opening the laptop area when intending to get in the main compartment. And with a double zip, it would be possible to allow a tall narrow object (like a tripod) to protrude out the top. In addition, I'd like a little more space in the main compartment - it's a tight fit for my 14"" tripod. Other items on my wish list would be a water-bottle holder, or, better yet, some loops on the outside that you could attach other items to. Despite my minor gripes, it's obvious there was a lot of attention to detail and the pack is well engineered. When opening the camera compartment with the bag on the ground, the top portion tilts back as if hinged to allow easy access to your gear. There is room for even a large 17"" laptop (Dell Latitude D810 - 14.25"" x 10.5"" x 1.75""). The front mp3 pocket is lined with soft cloth that won't scratch you ipod (or sunglasses) and there are good organizational features in the main compartment: couple zippered pockets, pen pockets, a key clip, etc. And all this is in an understated package that doesn't broadcast it may contain several thousand dollars worth of equipment inside - it just looks like a daypack. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this bag."

In the past I've had a tough time getting good prints from them from regular photo labs, and pro printers cost too much. I have experience with an older Nikon slide scanner, and I am getting much better results from the Epson V700 bed scanner. I see image improvements to 6400dpi, I scan to tiff at 48bit using the Epson software, then adjust color and contrast in photoshop cs2. I get very good results even from some warped slides where I always had focus problems when printed in the lab. Its very exciting to see these pictures again. Despite good reviews of this feature, I have yet to find an acceptable result from the included automatic dust removal, both hardware and software based. The dust is gone, replaced by strange pixelation. Much better to remove the dust by hand using the CS2 repair tool, which works like magic for me. After dust removal I increase sharpness using smart sharpening, and save to jpg. Its amazing the detail that emerges with a little sharpening. Resultant jpg is 20-35megs, but is compatible with local printer's fuji frontier printer. With the control I get from manipulating and color-converting the digital image, I get prints that come out exactly as I like, better than any  enlarger-based print I've ever obtained. I won't claim the v700 will scan better than a modern slide scanner because I've never used one, but the results I get are certainly better than I expected. It is surprising to me that these slide prints are on par with what I get from my nikon d70. Bed scanning of slides is pretty fast, about 45 minutes to scan 12 slides when scanning to my pentium m laptop. It take about a minute to put the old slides away and plop new ones into the holder. Installation was super easy. Just install driver, plug in, start scanning. But the documentation isn't so good. There is a lot involved in getting a good scan, its sort of an art. You'll need to read a bunch on the internet. When you first get the printer, play with all the settings, scan the same slide over and over with different slide-height settings, resolutions,etc, until you find what works for you. Have an idea what you want to see, then try stuff and see if you can make it happen. Like I said above, the auto dust removal might be convenient, but the results won't withstand close scrutiny. Ditto for the scanning software based ""color restoration"", ""sharpening"", or anything else. Just post-process the 48bit tiff in photoshop. I played around with the included silverfast SE scanning software, but found the interface clunky and there was no functional improvement over the included epson software, so I don't use it. The included detailed scan manipulation functions are all available in photoshop, so I don't bother. When scanning photos (as opposed to film or slides), the resolution makes a huge difference. Some resultions will alias the print pattern. Getting a good scan from a print requires patience."
526672,A9SBUG979IK2U,0,1,55,B000EZY19W,7/3/2006,4,53,53,Epson Perfection Scanner,"Outstanding product quality, but it takes work to get the best out of it. We bought this scanner to use mainly for scanning medium format film. The scanner resolution is excellent, and the ability to scan in 16 bit mode provides extended dynamic range and ability to capture subtle tone details. However, achieveing this always requires changing the default exposure levels, particularly on the low end of the scale. A limitation of the software, however, is that the histogram tool for setting the levels always shows the scale in a linear 8 bit mode (0 to 255 levels), whereas a log scale or optical density scale would probably be more appropriate for 16 bit scans. Photshop also does not have this feature but would benefit from it. A more troubling problem we have experienced is that all our film scans require changing the gamma of the blue channel significantly in order to achieve color balance. Once we had that figured out, the results have been excellent. The software documentation is pretty lame, as usual. As far as film handling goes, the slide holders seem adequate, but the film holders feel like they are going to break every time you use them. The medium format holder only holds the film by the long edges, which doesn't provide much support. One solution for this would be to improvise a filmholder which is like an enlarger holder in that it clamps the film on opposite sides of the image. The Epson filmholders have holes in them that the scanner uses to detect the holder type, and the software does a good job of detecting the borders of each image and presenting them all to you in the preview window. Despite these nit-picks, this scanner is an excellent value. The scans we are getting off of Fuji Velvia 100 are breathtaking. I hope that the availability of these will renew interest in medium and large format film, as these offer creative options which are impossible with digital cameras."
526670,A2UKH0INAIGEWN,0,0,53,B000EZY19W,5/12/2007,5,40,41,Highly Satisfied with the Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner,"I am highly satisfied with this product.  Scanning photos for me is a means to an end.  The goal is to share web-based images and pleasing prints, occasionally as large as 8.5"" X 11."" Prior to purchase, I researched extensively what I would need to digitize a large quantity of mostly personal photos - both those existing and any future pix I may take with my film equipment.  Since the majority of the photos are 35mm slides and negatives, my initial inclination was a Nikon Coolscan film scanner.  This was further reinforced by having been a Nikon user since the Nikon F days.  Two factors, however, steered me in the flatbed scanner direction. Studying reviews, both from sources such as Amazon's Customer Reviews and from other web sources convinced me that the Epson V700 would meet my needs from a scan-quality standpoint.  And, a closer look at my photo collection revealed that there were numerous prints without corresponding 35mm negatives and a surprising number of medium format negatives, too.  I felt it would be nice to digitize these, as well as the 35mm transparent material, but no film scanner could accommodate them all. I purchased the V700 scanner through Amazon with expedited shipping.  That went smoothly, as did the Epson set up. The V700's graphical user interface is straightforward.  Now, I have used for the last 5 years or so an Epson scanner in my business (embroidery design).  While that scanner is much more basic in functionality, my previous experience gives the V700's user interface a comfortable, familiar feel. I only installed the Epson Scanning Driver Software and the User Guide.  I use Adobe Elements 5.0 for any enhancement and cleanup that may be necessary. I scan in Professional Mode, and most always turn off all Epson features. This has to be verified each time, by the way, since they have an annoying habit of mysteriously turning themselves back on.  I could probably correct this, but haven't taken the time to delve into it since it's so easy to fix on the spot.  I've developed recipes for handling the varied media I scan. I put together a kit for film cleanup/preparation.  It includes PEC-12 solution, PEC Wipes, a soft brush, cotton gloves, a can of compressed air left over from my old darkroom days, a bulb blower (aka ear syringe), a soft brush and cotton swabs.  This kit, in combination with an antistatic plastic dustcover sized for flatbed scanners, has taken care of things so far.  (Where real damage has to be dealt with, the restorative functionality of Elements 5.0 must be utilized.) In addition to handling satisfactorily my scanning requirements, I like the way the V700 sits on my desk.  When not in use, if a stray document or two is placed on it temporarily, no harm is done.  It has its own on/off button conveniently located in front, which permits powering up my computer with or without powering up the scanner.   The V700 simply fits into what I do and want to do.  I am pleased with it."
526666,A8O2E6UBLWWFM,0,0,49,B000EZY19W,3/3/2007,5,18,20,light scans supreme,"This scanner is able to achieve outstanding results for the price of purchase.  Granted, for several hundred dollars more, you may buy a dedicated film scanner for 35mm, but the 700 will give very good results by any measure.  And that's for 35mm.  If you want to scan medium or large format film, something the dedicated film scanners can't do, this scanner is excellent.  It is also a fine choice for reflective scans. I really can't say enough good things about this scanner being an excellent value for the money.  It is gracefully holding its own in professional photo operations around the world.  And, if you need better scanning, you may invest in silverfast scanning software and scanner calibrator.  However, the enclosed Epson scan and Digital Ice work well for most applications.

It is very fast to set-up, and makes stunning scans.  I am using it to convert all of my old 35mm negatives to digital images, as well as some old photo prints.  You buy a scanner for its scanning, not the software that comes with it, and this is a solid scanner. The software for actually scanning from Epson is very simple to use, and works great.  LaserSoft Imaging SilverFast SE6 does not come with a manual, but when installing, you can install the manual as an option, and it links to their website and has very extensive and excellent instructions, including quick tour guides and videos on its use.  I don't see what anyone is complaining about below when it comes to the software?  Plus a copy of Photoshop Elements, you can't ask for more. The bottom line - don't be scared to buy this scanner, everything is great about it."

The v700 more than adequately handles them all, even allows for some enhancement of images from old slides and negatives. Before you buy, read the extensive testing and review of the v700 at http://www.photo-i.co.uk/Menus/reviews.htm, which includes detailed instructions and resulting photos. I'd really give this about 4 1/2 stars, as the scanner is slow and the included software is a little weak. I found that the professional version of VueScan brought out the best performance from the v700 for black and white negatives. We need to digitize the old family photos for the generations to come, and the v700 makes this possible."
526652,AWM2XN8BG9DTZ,0,0,35,B000EZY19W,5/21/2009,5,4,4,Very Nice Product - Totally Met Expectations,"Let me say up front that, because the V700 ships with a SilverFast image management program, this is essentially a joint review of device and software. We're a family of photographers with a lot of legacy negatives and slide material, some ours, some inherited from our parents. We've tried several scanners, with so-so results, and found them slow and somewhat clunky to use. Which meant we made little headway with the huge quantity of material we were trying to get into digital format. The reviews convinced us to try the V700, and we've been delighted. First, I won't say it's perfect - at this price point, we didn't expect to have a totally professional experience. If it were possible, we'd probably give it a 4.5 instead of a 5. Some of the glitches noted by others can be at least mildly irritating. Still, even with the basic SilverFast software shipped with it, it works much better than anything else we've tried. (And using the SilverFast Studio Ai with ME makes it even better - you have to order this separately, but you can get it as a download.) When used with the shipped SilverFast program, the device is intuitive, which results in a fast learning curve. (The videos on the SilverFast support site are extremely helpful should a question arise.) What has impressed us the most is the adjustability of the import controls, especially the ability to adjust F-stops 3 up or down on negative imports, which literally brings most heretofore unviable negative images ""back from the dead."" As to transparencies, the adjustments provided for their import are also helpful. If you combine this adjustment capability with Photoshop controls, it is truly amazing how much life you can return to images so faded or discolored that they're almost invisible to the naked eye. Evidently there's a lot more information left on even the worst of old slides and negatives than our cursory examination led us to believe. Also, we like the speed. The scan process is reasonable as to time required. Also, the ability to scan multiple images at once is cool. Which reminds me of the plastic holder issue. The V700 ships with a good assortment of sizes. Still, it would have been nice to have been offered the option of purchasing spares with the scanner at perhaps somewhat less than the rather breathtaking price charged by after-market vendors like SilverFast. As to ICE, unlike the experience of other reviewers, we definitely notice a difference when using ICE, especially on images with large areas of solid color. If you want to use ICE, do go through the steps of specifying exactly how you want to use it, as this very much affects not only speed but also the end output. The degree of detection and correction sensitivity that you set is critical. If you set the sensitivity high, you can get rid of just about any dust, etc., but the tradeoff for this much ""cleaning up"" is a significant degree of image softening. A setting somewhere in the middle seems to work best. We don't use ICE for closeup people images, instead doing any cleanup in Photoshop. Also, at least in our opinion, we would not use ICE to clean up material that is going to be reproduced in print form. There's more one could say, but I think the above is what we've observed from our experience that would matter to most users. In summation, we really like this product and recommend it."

For serious photographers.","My father in law, who has been scanning in thousands of slides, negatives and photos going back at least 60 years brought samples of every kind of photographic data to my house to test out this scanner. In the past I have scanned in many, many 35mm with a Canonscan 9950F. This scanner needed more stringent evaluation, it is obviously a powerhouse designed for serious users. We set up on DELL XPS 600 with Windows XP. Hardware setup easy, even for beginners.  Someone with experience would not even need directions. Tried the scanner with 35mm slides,  35mm  negatives, black and white color photos of different levels of quality.  It worked well with all of them and was able to restore poor quality photos automatically. He had some slides that are in 7mm square cardboard frames (Ektacrome) takes more creativity to fit into the holders and has to be sort of kludged together.  Those of us with some really old photographic material would appreciate the flexibility to perhaps purchase other holders for stranger sizes.  Understandably, they would not be included since most people would not need them. Color restoration on AutoScan was ok, but not Photoshop quality. Professional mode has many good choices of setting and produced superb results. Digital Ice works well to remove dust. We could not figure out how to do multiple scans in professional mode.  This may be due to the designers figuring that if you are using professional mode that you want to tweak the inputs yourself.  Went to create new field for storage and everything disappeared and had to spend time figuring out where the scan was sent. It is an excellent idea that that transparency feature is built into the machine. Top does not flop down easily, might not seem like a big deal but makes the media much easier to load when you don't have to hold up the top with one hand.  Scanning multiple pages to pdf is great and very functional.  The computer file user guide was useful. This is not a scanner for you if you want a simple product to input a few family photos.  If you are serious about digitizing years worth of photos or want to do specific detail work with your pictures then you may want to invest in it.   It has more flexibility than most scanners for digitizing images."

I know this will last for a long time, just like all the Epson equipment I've had in the past. Installation was a breeze, no problems at all.  Just make sure to follow the instructions and install the software before connecting and powering on the scanner.  I'm running Windows XP on a laptop with a dock and it took all of 25 seconds for the scanner to be ready on my machine once I powered the scanner on.  VERY fast and easy. The scanning software is very easy to use.  You can scan using 'Auto' mode, 'Home' mode or 'Professional' mode, each mode giving you more options to choose in your scanning. I tried all three scanning modes and I got beautiful scans with the 'Auto' mode, so I didn't fret about having to select a bunch of different options when scanning.  But, I also liked using the advanced modes and getting different looks to my scanned materials.  There's a great preview button that lets you view the options selected so you can quickly change an option if you don't like it. The scanning plate for negatives is easy to use and the scans came out wonderful!  I love seeing my old pictures again!  And it's wonderful that I can save the ones I want and delete the scanned items I don't want. No more wasting time figuring out which negatives I should get made into photos.

It also seems very quirky in the other programs you might try to use and any video codecs you may install. 2.  The DVD burner was also bad.  This took probably 4-5 tries with customer service.

Before making this purchase I reviewed the CPA Computer report Accountants Guide to Going Paperless, the AICPA IT section whitepapers, I attended a few paperless workshops, and I read Amazon reviews of earlier Fujitsu products and Visioneer products. My unit serial number was #5XX, so mine is one of the first of this model sold. This review is based on only one week of experience using the S500, but I think it is better to share this information now than to wait until I have more to report. The S500 appears to be similar to the previous model the FI5110EOX2 which has been heavily, and positively, reviewed on Amazon and also in the references listed above. Differences between the S500 and the earlier 5110 are as follows - * Integration with ABBY OCR, so the S500 can produce searchable PDF's and other formats!!! This was a major limitation with the 5110EOX2 which could only produce graphic PDFs.  The ABBY OCR is not perfect, but hopefully gets enough keywords right to make the document findable. * One touch scan to PDF, to Word, to Excel, to Power Point, to ScanSnap Organizer (which produces searchable PDFs), and to Cardminder (for business cards). * Inclusion of Adobe Acrobat 7.0! * 20% improved scan speed (up to 16 pages per minute, with a 50 page feed bin), and the ability to append consecutive batches to the same PDF file. In practice I think I will often be using highest resolution (Excellent, 1200dpi/600dpicolor) mode with max compression, which is significantly slower - about 25sec/page scan time and 10sec/page OCR time on my new Compaq presario laptop.  The lower resolution modes (going down to Fastest, 300dpi/150dpicolor) might be sufficient for older print documents without marks or illustrations, that do not have much value to me, that I doubt I will ever look at again but can't just toss. * Automatic document size detection so you can feed batches of mixed size documents. (plus all the document handling features from the 5110, including reasonably good automatic handling of mixed single sided and double sided documents) * File compression which is claimed to reduce file sizes 20-50 percent. * A significant cash manufacturers [censored] for purchases from authorized dealers is currently available for this product through the Fujitsu website. Here are the limitations I have seen with this scanner so far (4000 scans of documents and business cards) - * It sometimes feeds two sheets at once, most often the first two sheets in a batch, so I will have to keep my eye on the first sheets it feeds. If the documents have page numbers it will be easy to know how many documents I have fed and compare this with the scanner count. If the documents do not have page numbers I will need to count them by hand, or keep I very close eye on the scanner throughout the scan, or just live with a very occasional missed page due to the mechanism feeding two sheets at once. * I assume staples will damage the mechanism, and so I will have to carefully inspect all documents for staples before scanning. * The OCR is alright but not perfect. There are frequent OCR mistakes when scanning business cards, and several mistakes per page on spreadsheets (7's sometimes become 1's, 5's sometimes become S's, 0's sometimes become O's, missing decimal points, extra junk characters etc). White text on black background and black text on grey background have poor results. Fortunately the graphic image is retained in the searchable PDF, and is also retained in Cardminder, so that even when the OCR is not perfect I can still see what the original looked like. * If a spreadsheet had relationships between the columns, I can recalculate the relationship and compare my recalculation with the scanned information, which seems to detect almost all errors in scans to Excel. * Scan to Word often results in a slightly different format or positioning of text than the original document. * The scanner does not support TWAIN (a uniform driver interface for scanners), instead it has a proprietary interface. Based on my research, the proprietary interface is better than TWAIN, so if the included software meets your needs then this is not a limitation. However if you absolutely must use some 3rd party software that requires TWAIN then you should not buy this scanner! * The PDF files produced by the system are not fully compressed, even with maximum compression selected.  Running PKZIP does not increase the compression significantly, however in Adobe 7.0 I click File | Reduce File Size | For Adobe 7.0 and subsequent, and files compress perhaps by up to 80% !  This additional Adobe compression claims to have no loss of visual quality and is fast for PDFs of a few megabytes, but quite slow for huge PDFs, and seems to produce much more additional compression on high resolution scans than on low resolution scans.  Why can't Fujitsu/Abby use this Adobe 7.0 super compressed mode to begin with or add it to their batch process manager?  I have not figured out how to get the system to reduce this annoying extra process step. * After installing the scanner, Outlook caused my XP system to hang three times a day with a fatal ""STOP ERROR"" causing a blue screen and a reboot. I called tech support, and found it very easy to reach a live person who listened to me sympathetically and had some useful troubleshooting information, but did not have an immediate fix and took me down a few false paths. Microsoft crash analysis was worse than useless and incorrectly concluded that the problem was in my graphics driver which was not the case. In the end, through trial and error, I diagnosed the problem myself. It turned out that the Blue Soleil bluetooth USB wireless networking drivers installed in my system and plugged into Outlook were incompatible with something in the S500 package, perhaps with the S500 drivers or the Adobe 7.0 Outlook plugin. Uninstalling Blue Soleil caused the problem to go away completely. * Every now and then (2%?) of scans, when I press the green scan button or when I click continue in the scansnap manager window, the image scanning and file saving window comes up on my screen, but the feed motor never starts turning.  The system appears locked up, and the only way to reliably start scanning again seems to be to disconnect and reconnect the power plug on the back of the scanner. * When scanning paper that is rough or perforated, sometimes the ejecting page will push the previously scanned page out of its neat stack in the output pile, and in the worst case spill several pages from the output pile onto the floor!  I have learned to place the scanner at the rear of a deep desk, and to set a block at the front of the desk at the front end of output pile to push back against any paper that tries to fall out. * I was able to use the software to convert some previously scanned graphic PDFs to searchable PDF's, however the Abby manual does claim that only files produced by ScanSnap are supported (though I suppose one could always print a hardcopy and then scan it again using ScanSnap). Despite the problems listed above, this system is helping me better communicate with my clients, and in the long term I think it will significantly reduce the clutter in my office."
526540,A1Y29X25XTIJPL,0,1,52,B000F3YSQ4,5/11/2006,4,48,49,Excellent buy!,"I was looking for a scanner that could digitize pages larger (in length) that standard letter size (8,5x11 inches). In my country (Chile) nobody now sells legal size scanners (or almost scanners at all - they have all moved to multifunctional devices). When shopping at Amazon for this specific figure, I found this very new product (even in the Fujitsu page it is quite new). I wondered if it would work for my needs. In that sense, Scansnap S500 was and is an excellent buy. It worked flawlessly from the first scan. I was surprised with the speed of the scans! I couldn't measure the speed, but I believe from the jobs I did that the 18PPM speed is accurate. The adobe acrobat standard version 7.0 is an excellent bundle, as well as the ScanSnap Organizer and the ABBYY Finereader OCR software. I was very pleased with the simple way of scanning the documents with the software. Put the batch, press a green button and that's it. ScanSnap Organizer pops up and everything goes smoothly. Afterwards, I can edit the documents with Adobe Acrobat. Why I didn't give it 5 stars: very simple - the driver from Fujitsu does not comply with the Windows logo testing. A warning pops up when plugging the USB cable and windows XP detects the hardware. Fujitsu should spend just the little effort that is needed to get the driver properly certified. This is not the time of the Apple III, Macintosh or Original IBM PC, where writing a driver was a major task. The same with the minimum effort that means developing a driver that is Twain/ISIS compliant. These two minor issues should be addressed by Fujitsu soon. Both issues were clearly documented, so no surprises. At least the documentation is very clear about them. In summary, I really recommend the product for its use. The price is very competitive and the software bundle is extremely attractive."
526539,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,0,1,51,B000F3YSQ4,6/2/2007,4,23,23,amazingly fast document scanner,"Wow!  That is the first word that came to my mind when I scanned my first document with the Fujitsu S500 scanner.  Wow!  It scanned so quickly that I wasn't sure I did it correctly until I saw the .pdf file pop up in Adobe Acrobat only moments later.  If you are needing a fast document scanner, you need look no further. Everything about this scanner reflects quality.  It arrives well-packaged with all necessary connecting cables, software (including Adobe Acrobat 7 standard edition), and documentation.  The S500 is much smaller than I had envisioned from its picture, but this is a big benefit as it takes up very little space on the desktop.  Despite its small size, the scanner feels solidly built.  The power supply has a standard detachable AC cord so there is no brick to take up valuable outlet space.  The printed documentation is outstanding.  A full-sized printed manual is provided (in several languages) which is detailed and thorough.  The S500 scanner is quite intuitive to use, but the manual leaves no question about how to use it properly. The scanner opens somewhat like a flower.  One simply lifts up the lid, which forms a backboard for your documents, and then fold down an inner lip to catch the scanned documents as they exit the scanner.  A power button is present when you open up the scanner, but you really never need to use it -- the scanner automatically turns on when you open it up and shuts itself off when you fold everything back in place.  The only other button is a large scan button, which makes scanning documents extremely simple.  When closed back up the scanner's interior is completely covered, keeping it dust-free. The S500 scanner is very versatile.  You can scan full-color documents in a wide variety of sizes without any special configuration -- the scanner will automatically sense their margins and make the appropriate scan.  I found this even worked with thin, thermal paper credit card receipts without any special handling.  You can place a stack of documents in the scanner and configure it to scan them automatically and in sequence.  Odd-sized documents (e.g. newspaper clippings, photographs, etc.) can be scanned using the included carrier sheet.  The scanner can be configured to send scanned documents to a variety of programs including Adobe Acrobat; Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint; Cardminder (a business card organizer that can route scanned business cards directly into Microsoft Outlook); ABBYY Finereader (an OCR software); and SnapScan Organizer (a .pdf organizer).  The software can also be configured to make searchable .pdf files.  All of the software mentioned above, except for the Microsoft Office software, is included with the scanner.  The S500 is small enough that it could be easily used as a portable scanner.  In fact, a carry case is available for separate purchase from online vendors. The thing that really sets the Fujitsu S500 scanner apart from other scanners is its blazing speed.  The S500 warms up very rapidly (literally within seconds), scans a document on one or both sides automatically within seconds, and quickly generates a full-color .pdf file.  I have never seen such a fast scanner.  You really have to see it to believe it.  By comparison, it would take me several minutes to scan even a single document on one side with my Hewlett Packard 6300c flatbed scanner.  The difference in scanning speed is absolutely incredible.  Despite its rapid scanning speed, document scan quality is quite good with the S500, and it is certainly good enough for accurate OCR with the included ABBYY Finereader software.  Scanning resolution can be adjusted, although it is a little awkward to configure.  Scanned images are inferior with the S500 even when configured to scan at the highest resolution/quality setting.  My flatbed scanner clearly makes nicer image scans, although it takes much longer to produce them. Fujitsu's customer service is somewhat lacking.  My scanner arrived with a corrupt SnapScan setup disk.  Calling Fujitsu customer service sent me on a merry chase from one phone menu to another.  It took seemingly forever to ultimately connect with a human.  Once I did, though, the friendly customer service representative directed me to Fujitsu's ftp site where I was able to download the needed software and burn my own replacement CD.  I'm sure they would have happily mailed me a replacement if I had requested it.  Where the service is lacking, aside from the maddening loops of phone menus, is the poor sales support.  If you call customer service for pre-sales information, after going through endless phone menus, you will ultimately be told to leave a voicemail for a representative to call you back.  The S500 owners manual recommends replacing the scanner carrier sheet after 500 scans and provides a part number for a 5-pack of carrier sheets (which turns out not to be a correct part number).  But you cannot purchase replacement carrier sheets from Fujitsu!  The Fujitsu customer service agent I spoke with had no idea where you could purchase replacement carrier sheets and referred me to a 3rd party vendor in New York who said they could order them but couldn't give me an accurate price.  Eventually, I found online vendors where they can be purchased after doing a Google search (I have since found out you can purchase them through an Amazon vendor). There are some negative aspects to the S500 scanner.  Since it is designed to be used primarily as a document scanner you can scan only sheet-fed individual documents.  You cannot scan books or any other bound materials unless you unbind them into individual sheets.  There is no Twain driver for the S500 scanner (Fujitsu sells other scanner models that do have a Twain driver), so you cannot make scans within other programs -- instead, all scans have to be made through the SnapScan program, which can then direct them to the programs mentioned earlier in this review.  This limits the software you can use with the S500 scanner.  Depending upon what you intend to scan, you have to readjust the configuration settings within the SnapScan program before your scan.  This is awkward and should be more automatic.  It takes only seconds, however, to make these adjustments.  As mentioned above, scan quality for images is somewhat poor.  The S500 is not the scanner to use if you want to scan primarily images or photos.  Lastly, customer service support for this scanner leaves a lot to be desired. In summary, the Fujitsu S500 scanner is a blazingly fast, compact, high-quality scanner that comes fully-equipped with excellent software including Adobe Acrobat standard.  You will find yourself looking for documents to scan with it.  The scanner is well worth its higher price.  If you are searching for a fast, high-quality document scanner, you need look no further.  However, if you are primarily wanting high-quality image or photo scans, you will probably prefer a good flatbed image scanner.  Please also note the Fujitsu S500 is a Windows-only scanner, so you will want to purchase the S500M model for usage with a Mac."

I don't use it every day, but have scaned a hundred pages or so at a time when I do use it, which is several times per month. The features I like: 1. Very fast at scanning, makes very few mistakes. 2. Scans double sided docs well. 3. Compact - it folds up to less than the size of a printer when not in use. 4. Software is great for quick conversion to pdf files. The only issue I have with it is that it mis-feeds once in a while I am very please with this purchase and would recommend this product to others.

Complaint - cannot control and adjust the features and scanning qualities between the scanner & computer, must use the snapscan software to access the scanner & computer; scanner is not TWAIN compatible at this point.  Note that scanning multiple copies, be careful to fan or separate leading edge of paper to prevent multiple pages being pulled through."
526516,A1PM2YWT66WOUC,0,1,28,B000F3YSQ4,3/23/2007,5,6,8,A good Value,"I purchased the ScanSnap after a lot of on-line study and on the recommendation of a friend. It has worked out flawlessly for me so far. I made a New Year's resolution to go paperless this year and have been busy converting all my utility, bank and investment accounts over. Most companies are very happy to comply as they like the cost savings of not having to print and mail statements and will archive the old records for years. However there are some small firms that send you mostly occasional statements and the like that you can not convert to paperless billing. In addition there are plenty of routine mail we all receive that we have to faithfully file away for tax time or the occasional time you need to check back on. Add to this the clippings you have saved, be it recipes, hobby interests or whatever that fill many a file folder each year. Now I simply pass them through the auto paper handler on the ScanSnap and convert them to searchable PDFs in seconds. I set up a complete set of 'file folders' or 'cabinets' as Fujitsu likes to call them and drag the newly created PDFs over using their software or Windows Explorer. I also have been slowly emptying old file folders and scanning in 20-30 pages of old bills and statements at a time when ever I have spare time. It is my goal to recycle two complete file cabinets this spring! So far (3 weeks) the scanner has been working great and I love the convenience of the whole system. Oh and another thing that is great, I travel a lot between two residences, boating and of course the office - and it always seems the stuff I need is somewhere else. But that is no longer an issue with these new files, I just plan on loading up a USB pen drive with the PDFs and taking them with me where ever I go. Go paperless, it's great!"

526447,A24TCU4X4T7AAQ,0,1,46,B000FA1G26,4/10/2006,5,96,98,Working great for me!,"I need to first say that I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this unit and have spent a great deal of time researching previous models XS-32/34/52/54, and read many, many, many user reviews on them, as well as downloaded and reviewed the installation and operation user manuals for most of them. After all my research I narrowed it down to 2 models which best suited my needs, the XS52 and this one, XS35. They are both very similar using the same 160 GB HD, same IR blaster funtion to set top cable/sat box, and same navigation software, but there are a few major differences.  The XS52 will only burn to -R/-RAM while the XS35 will burn to -R/-RW and -RAM. Why they left -RW out of XS52, I don't know.  The other thing is that the XS52 uses the VCR+ Plus timer recording feature where the XS35 uses the TVGuide OnScreen system.  VCR+ Plus codes are not listed in my local paper or guide, so this would be a pain for me to have to search for and setup, although I am sure it works fine, the TVGOS is much easier for me.  The last difference I could see is the XS52 offers an HDMI output and upconversion on DVD playback to 480p, 720p and 1080i for ""near-HD"" quality. The only thing I didn't like about the XS35 was that it didn't have the upconversion like the XS52, but was I really missing something here??? I wanted to know if I should get the XS52 for the upconversion, so I brought home a Toshiba upconverting DVD player to see if I could tell the difference in quality between it and the XS35's progressive scan DVD player.  After watching my favourite scenes on many DVD's I decided that I could not tell any difference which made my choice much easier.  I wanted to save my HDMI input on my TV for later this year or next year when HD DVD/Blu-ray become more available, those DVD's will make a huge difference.  So I went out and bought the XS35. Some of the features of the XS35: 1) TVGOS program guide:  A lot of people have been reporting problems with this on older versions.  I cannot say that I have had any problems with this.  In fact it was the easiest thing to set up.  It simply asks for your zip/postal code and within 24 hours of setup it has downloaded all the channels to it's guide and all the programming for 8 days.  This is very convienient to use with the timer programming, I can tape ""Lost"" weekly and ""South Park"" daily and it will do it for me.  So far I really enjoy this system since I don't have cable or satellite and I don't have a guide, this is really nice to see what is on next. If I did have a Cable/Sat box I could use the IR blaster to change to channel 405 at 10:00 pm then to channel 253 at 12:00 pm and it would do it.  This is what the manual says and although I have not used this feature it is a nice one to have for potential future use. You can also just press REC and start recording to the HDD instantly instead of setting up a timed recording.  Just press stop to stop it. 2) DVD - the playback is as good as I could imagine.  I had been using my Xbox as a DVD player.  I can't say I see any huge differences or improvements, but it isn't worse either.  Both are great for me. The benefit is that I can burn to DVD anything I want to keep, (superbowl, movies on tv, seasons of tv shows, etc.) It does support both DVD-R/RW and RAM unlike XS52 which only supports -R and -RAM. 3) The fan does not run all the time, like many have said about the XS54.  It is very quiet when it does run. The lights on the front make it easy to see what you are doing at the moment.  If you are recording there is a red light ring around one of the buttons on the front of the unit. If you are on the HDD a blue light is on and when on the DVD it lights up green.  There are separate lights too not just one so if you are color blind (like my dad) you are not confused by only one light position. 4) The easy-navi button gets you right into the list of programs you have saved and is easy to use.  Easy to delete when finished with a certain recording and it tells you how much time you have left to use on the disk to manage your files. 5) Playback - Great playback features.  You can playback a recording while recording another program live. You can also pause live TV with the Timeslip feature and then skip through commercials in 5s, 10s, 30s or 5 minute intervals to catch up to the live feed, also skip back at 5 s intervals if you missed something. All in all I am happy with this HDD/DVD recorder and despite not having the HDMI upconversion for DVD playback (which I can't see a difference in anyway) it has everything I think you could want. There are going to be other units Panasonic/Pioneer available that do similar things but I like the way this one works. 5 stars from me...good luck!"
526446,A3RRBPUGD7UOSP,0,0,45,B000FA1G26,8/23/2006,4,37,39,"A Few Minor Issues, But a Great Unit","My wife and I purchased this unit as a co-anniversary present to each other. We wanted to replace a VCR that was used to occasionally tape TV shows, the news, etc., so we decided on a DVD recorder that had a hard drive for DVR recording. I read reviews on various models, and decided on this one. I haven't been disappointed. While some reviewers mention the fan noise as a problem, I haven't seen it as such. The fan (apparently) is temp-controlled, because it seems to get louder when using the unit, and stays louder for a few minutes after the unit is shut off. It's not incredibly loud, but it is noticeable. The one negative I have to agree with other reviewers on is the manual and on-screen guide. They are not user intuitive at all. I am a highly technical person, and spent quite a while the first night trying to figure out how to play a DVD, even after thumbing through the manual. Now that I've figured out how to use the DVD player, I've watched a dozen or so DVDs, and have absolutely no complaints. The video and sound playback are excellent. I've used the DVR a half dozen times, and love it. I don't know how I survived without it. You simply go to a show on the TV guide on-screen, and press the record button. That is, after you've set up the basic recorder settings when you first unpack the unit. Once the unit records, you go to the 'content menu' which shows the shows you've recorded, the title, channel, etc, and even shows a screenshot! To play it back, you navigate to the one you want to watch and press 'play'. The coolest thing about it, and the DVD player, is that when you stop a show or disk, turn the unit off, and come back later, the unit knows exactly where you were when you stopped, and resumes from there. Sweet! I'm set up to record a show using the DVR, that I will burn to a DVD. I will update my review once that is done, so that I can give my impression of that part of the unit, which is the only thing I've yet to do with it. 12-4-06 - Update Now that I've had the unit for a couple of months, I wanted to update my review, especially having had time to play with the DVD authoring aspect of the unit, which for me was a secondary item. I wanted the unit mostly for the ability to DVR without having to pay TiVo a monthly fee. The DVR works flawlessly, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've burned a handful of DVD disks using the unit and found it not particularly easy to do, although not overtly so. The manual, as previously noted, is not a lot of help.  Of the 5 disks that I've burned, three of them were 'fully authored', meaning that I went in and manually added chapter breaks, created thumbnails for each chapter and for the main menu for each episode. This is VERY time consuming, so I didn't do it on the last two disks. The fourth disk causes any DVD player I put it in to lockup after five minutes or so. I don't know if this is because the unit automatically puts in chapter breaks at 5 minute intervals or what. I'm going to edit the content of that fourth disk, and burn it again to see if that makes the difference. As a side note, I found that the unit will not recognize DVD+R disks, so you have to make sure you use DVD-R or DVD-RW formatted ones."
526442,ANKF54Y5737A1,0,1,41,B000FA1G26,7/11/2006,5,11,11,No Complaints Yet! - Updated 03.07.07,"This was a birthday present to myself so, I had the unit barely a month. [Update 03.07.07 - Almost a year later and still going strong!] My unit gets cable directly from a wire coming out the wall, no cable box. (I have a funny story how that wire was a really good antennae...)  That said, the TVGOS worked within 24hrs, I've had no problem since.  Very nice to have a week's teeevee listings and not need the teeevee guide in the paper.  The TVGOS allows searching for shows by alphabetical, keyword, genre or just scanning the grid for listings. The manual is more like a magazine, I would advise you to work with this machine frequently, and keep the manual nearby.  I didn't have much problem with the language of the manual, and everything is pretty much laid out straightforwardly. My only criticism re: the manual is that it could use an index. This is not the most intuitive machine in the world, it is complicated, and it'll be a while before you get things doped out.  The unit provides a handful of indicators of it's activity at any given moment, and indicates whether you are working with the HDD or the DVD drive. One thing that is good is that there are usually a few methods and menus to do similar actions. To date, I have recorded shows using the TVGOS, recorded shows just by hitting the ""Rec"" button on the remote and I have recorded shows from one of my VCRs directly to the HDD.  At present, I have started to record to DVD-RAM discs in order to not used the HDD extensively.  You can edit on either disc drive (Update 03.07.07 - provided you use a DVD-RAM disc).  I have also loaded DVD-RAM discs from my old DVD recorder, though programs from those discs must be loaded on to the HDD to do any editing.  I have copied back and forth between discs and copied edited programs to DVD-R/RW for finalization.  This can be done in a ""high speed"" mode or in some cases you have to do it in real time. The deal is that you have an ""Original"" program that you set edit points within, and then edit together the ""chapters"" that you wish to make your final program which the unit calls a ""Playlist"".  If you are satisfied with the playlist, then you make a copy and the ""Playlist"" becomes an ""Original"".  DON'T delete the ""Original"" before making your ""Playlist"" an ""Original"" or you will have nothing. Re:  The Program Editor Mode I find it a little clunky. You can set edit points with four rocker switches on the remote which set the points forward or back at various speeds.  CAVEAT! The edit points wind up being a little sloppy on the finished discs, they don't wind up exactly where you want them, they kind of wind up maybe a few frames earlier than you have set them for.  YMMV, I like to take out the commercials and leave a little more dark space than most broadcasters provide (Usually less than a second!) so you may wind up with the last frame or two of the end of a commercial. [Update 03.07.07 - When setting the edit points after any given commercial break, you should allow a buffer of about 13 frames after the end of the last commercial and the resumption of the program.  If you don't do this, then you will see about half a second of the end of the last commercial.  Nitpicky, yes, but you may want a smoother transition between scenes and you DID want to edit out the commercials...] So far, I am happy with the machine, I haven't had any of the problems with the fan being loud, didn't even notice it till I had to change some wires and I was directly behind the thing. [Update 03.07.07 - I did have a problem once with the Program Editor Mode where the time elapsed indicator wouldn't indicate the elapsed time and the window showing the program being edited in progress wouldn't work properly.  The time elapsed on the program being viewed wouldn't be indicated on the front of the unit, and a few other features wouldn't operate. I phoned Toshiba, got a prompt answer from a live operator who had me unplug, then re-plug the machine.  I did so and all functionality returned to the machine and I lost none of the programs I had on HDD.] I made sure to get a 2 year extended service contract though... One thing: The volume level when using the RCA jacks directly into the audio in of my teeevee is really low.  This does not affect the finished product when I put it in my plain old DVD player I use strictly for playing DVDs. Edit: Another thing: DO NOT (!) use Verbatim brand DVD-RW discs on the spindle, I have moved to Memorex brand in the individual jewel cases, presumably non-spindle discs are manufactured to a higher tolerance.  The Verbatim discs typically wouldn't Format, or would Format after 3 tries, but the disc would fail on Finalize mode, creating another drink coaster. [Update 03.07.07 - I stand my my recommendation of Memorex brand discs, and have used TDK as well to near 100% success, even using those on a spindle.]"
526438,AW6C7JQYFYE7P,0,1,37,B000FA1G26,5/1/2006,5,8,8,Surprised with Quality,"I have to say I was surprised with the quality and the product after reading so many negative reviews of other DVD recorders.  It wasn't hard to set up, I've recorded various sources to the harddrive, made chapter divisions, and recorded to DVD's.  They have also played on other DVD devices.  I don't read instructions unless I have to, but other than the hidden compartment on the remote, everything works like I'd expect it to.  I was skeptical and bought the longest warranty I could buy, but I am pleasantly pleased, and would highly recommend purchase to others who are looking for more than a low end machine."
526437,A237RMB2EXP0JJ,0,1,36,B000FA1G26,1/10/2007,5,7,7,Very satisfied so far,"I got this unit so I could archive shows from TV straight to DVD. The manual recommended Maxell DVD-R blank disks for recording, I got the 16X version, no problems so far. I haven't tried DVD-RWs and don't care if I do. The TV Guide works as promised, I have Time-Warner Cable. I have copied some old programs from VHS to the hard drive , then to DVD-R after editing out the commercials, the final picture quality was the same as the original VHS which is to be expected. The picture quality is very good from the new shows copied from cable to hard drive to DVD, again as expected. Some of the issues from other reviewers I researched before buying: Cooling fan runs alot (yes it does, doesn't bother me), Manual (Could have been better but I understood it), Remote buttons (a lot of them, just watch what you're doing), Setting up recording off TV (both from TV Guide or manually, read the manual and watch what you're doing). I've had it for 2 months now and no problems, most of the shows I watch have to be recorded while I'm at work and I used to switch several VHS tapes around. Having everything go to the hard drive is much easier and deleting the shows after I have watched the ones I don't want to save takes a few button pushes and 10 seconds for the hard drive to work."

First, it has great sound with decent left/right speakers, and a subwoofer below the unit. It has a Surround Sound button, a 4-band equalizer, and separate treble/base settings (in case you don't want to use one of the preset equalizer settings).  It has 10 FM and 10 AM preset buttons.  It can play regular CDs and mp3 CDs.  The docking station supports every variation of ipods, including the ipod shuffle. It also is an Alarm clock that allows to you wake up to buzzer, radio, CD, or ipod (not ipod shuffle though).  The docking station actually charges the ipod shuffle even when the iE600BK power is off.  Like most alarm clocks, it also has a ""sleep"" button to allow the unit to turn itself off after 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes.  It has an AUX input and an earphone jack.  It has a very contemporary look - black with blue neon side-lights that light up when the power is on (the sidelights can be turned off).  Here are the few negatives:  It does not have a resume feature for picking up an mp3 at the last spot you left off.  While the remote control operates all operations on the machine and any ipod, the remote does not operate the ipod shuffle.  You must use the buttons on the ipod shuffle itself. I found this to be a great sounding little unit with exceptional volume for your standard office or bedroom use!"

But the phone works great with Skype once it's setup properly.  The range is incredible!  I have a three story house and my computer is all the way upstairs jammed in the far corner of the house.  The signal is excellent all the way down to the bottom level of my home, and to the other end.  I may save some a little confusion by letting you know that the phone takes over as your pc speaker while the phone is in use.  So if you end a call, and then sign onto AOL or start playing a song, the audio plays in the phone, and not on the PC speakers.  I finally figured out that the phone goes into ""sleep"" mode 3 minutes after you stop using it, and the audio is restored to the PC speakers.  For those who want to fidget with the audio settings, there are settings in both Windows XP as well as the Skype settings.  I just left my settings ""as is"".  Seems to get the job done!  I also might mention that I have Linksys Wireless SRX Router downstairs in my office.  When I'm very close to the router, it does cause a little static/hiss with the phone reception.  But otherwise, the phone reception is CRYSTAL CLEAR!  I give it two thumbs up !!"

The voice quality is clear, the range is fantastic for a bluetooth device, it syncs pretty well with Skype, and it's relatively easy to use.  The only complaints that I have for the phone are as follows: 1) The phone sometimes requires more than one attempt to sync up with Skype when you first turn it on, and 2) Whenever you turn the phone on, the device automatically becomes your default audio device for the computer, which means that you'll hear all the rest of you computer's sounds when you are in the middle of your conversation, and in order to change the default audio device back to your regular speakers, you frequently have to do so manually, or wait for the phone to go into sleep mode after a few minutes of inactivity."

As such it has all the tools a serious chess player can want - a million game database, training and analysis modes, a year's subscription to Playchess, etc. I own both Fritz 9 and Hiarcs 10 and thouroghly recommend both. Fritz and Hiarcs have long been rivals. In playing strength Fritz has usually been slightly stronger (at least in games against other engines.) However,strength (particularly against other computers) is not the only consideration. The top 5 engines are certainly a match for the world's top grandmasters, and what an owner wants is a program that is useful for analysis. What Hiarcs offers is its own unique playing style. It is often said that Hiarcs is the most ""human-like"" computer opponent. To my mind no computer really plays like a human but I can understand what the many Hiarcs fans mean. Hiarcs has a very individual style and is less material-oriented than many programs, often ignoring the gain of a pawn, for example, in favour of the initiative. In keeping with this style of play the program comes with an opening book that is decidedly quirky, with all sorts of interesting lines of play. Hiarcs fans will be delighted with this version of the program and any serious chess player will find it a very powerful tool."

I feared a much steeper slope of getting used to it's applications, and other than some small frustrations (Microsoft Messenger and skype not allowing video calls) this makes a good case for being my best notebook ever. The Good - Shiny screen, accomodating the new form factor was quite easy - the wireless configuration was VERY VERY easy - connecting a HD video camara to the firewire connector, and using the built-in iMovie software was amazingly easy - I haven't missed the modem at all.  leaving it out was the right move - the phonebooth application is really cool - the ""on"" indicator for the iSight camera (small led) next to it is very cleverly placed. - no complains at all about the time it can run on batteries, outperforms my Dell NB (one with brand new battery) The Great - the magnetic attachment for the power connection to the notebook, and the subtle on indicator (orange/green) is a great feature - the keyboard is really comfortable.  Hard for the letters to be removed (great when you have a pet) - you will hardly find where the microphone is... and you don't need to.   You can use skype with the NB in a speaker-phone-like set-up w/o any issues - it is really fast on Mac OS.  I'm just waiting for bootcamp to stop being beta to install it - the structure is really solid (I have to say it after using IBM's T40s for years.. those are amazingly easy to damage and not that solid) The not-that good - It gets hot! and I don't mean only warm.  If you want to put it in your lap after it has been running for a couple of hours, it will be uncomfortable enough (almost burning) on your left leg that you won't stand it. - Even at the max volume it is not loud enough.  Such a shame to miss that simple variable in such a great home notebook - Slightly heavier than what I expected - (FrontRow issue in reality).  I just hate how the podcasts I suscribe with get mixed with the songs.  I ended up building a specific ""music"" playlist to get rid of that issue - Ejecting the DVD/CDs: in one of every 3 cases, the CD gets stuck and I find myself doing small acrobatic moves to get it out"
528298,A1MQQEM7W77L62,0,1,43,B000EPLRFI,6/12/2006,5,19,19,Another Hit from Apple,"What great deal this laptop is! Don't try to use advertised prices of windows laptops. The Macs come with so many features as standard equipment they are not really comparable. iphoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, and garage band allows the average person to use and edit their photo's, video's, music they've bought, and music they've made on their own, and the software is easy to use. i had a Powerbook G4 and the Intel Macbook blows it away. This is a really fast laptop, and it was easy to add software and content from my old computer to my new powerbook with software included on powerbooks. It walks you through the transfer and using firewire makes it very fast. Unlike my old G4 the powerbook comes with a glossy screen. It's GREAT. The screen is much brighter, and the colors much more vibrant then the older screens. I was worried about reflections, and yes if you put the sun behind you, you'll have a problem. But in every other situation this a great display.  I used to have problems seeing the screen out on the deck, or in a car (no, not driving) but with the glossy screen it is much easier to work out of doors. Lastly I think that since Apple has vastly increased system bus speeds, and is using faster memory has contributed to dramatic increase in performance. Windows people should rest assured switching will be a pleaurable experience. And those of you upgrading from power pc Macs can rest assured the change to Intel is a good think. Oh by the way: we haven't had any problems with noise, this computer runs very quite. It is warm on the bottom as are most laptops. I have seen the video's on YouTube.com about noisey fans, and the ones I've seen are using graphics intensive applications for prolonged periods of time. When you use the processor is used intensively it needs to be cooled. In both situatons I would recommend one of those laptop coolers/shields. Most people with a laptop already have one, some have fans built in, that run off a USB port, and some are passive and work very well. I use the latterf with great success."
528297,A2BL4FRHG09DEA,0,1,42,B000EPLRFI,7/26/2006,5,16,17,Go Mac & Never Look Back!,"I have been scouting Macs since a close friend called me up from Hawaii one evening and told about his recent experience in seeing a demo on GarageBand. As a music composer and performer, I knew a lot about PC software and have been a Cakewalk customer for numerous years.  But something within my friend's voice persuaded me to go to the nearest Apple store the next day just to see if his hype was real and this friend is pretty level headed and calm all the time. Upon my visit, I checked out GarageBand and this was my first experience with a Mac in at least 12 to 13 years and even then I was not a regular user of Apple's products. The first thing about using a Mac as a PC user is that you expect things to be more complicated than Apple has made them.  Everything about a Mac is simplified to the nth degree.  I had bought my wife an iPod Mini which was just as simple as every other product we have been exposed to. Then after seeing the simplicity of GarageBand, I have put the Mac Mini and then the MacBook Pro in my crosshairs.  Then on my birthday in May, Apple releases the Macbook.  It could get no better than this for the price and the power built within the Macbook. The Macbook has even matched or exceeded some of the supposedly more powerful computers such as the MacBook Pro or G5 as one online review indicated. Every application is simple and once you accept the fact everything about being a Mac user is simple.  Faster boot up times, no blue screens of death, no cumbersome viruses, and life just gets easier. I have had my black MacBook in my hands since June 28, 2006 and it has been truly a red-letter day for me.  I am using products within the iLife suite and more. When it is possible to install Windows products without installing Windows XP either later this month (July) or August, I will add my favorite PC programs.  Otherwise, I will probably buy Parallels over Boot Camp since I want to be able to run Sonar Home Studio XL beside GarageBand via ReWire. Music does not get any better or simpler to produce.  I just discovered a device to connect analog video to the USB port on the Macbook as well. With the built wireless access, you will never realize how much you previously gave up by being tied down with desktop computers. Thank you Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Andy Grove!  The 2006 Macbook is truly a winner!"

The new glossy screen is a total pleasure - bright and ultra sharp. The new keyboard is a treat to use and the built-in iSight camera is even better than the one Apple sells separately. My only negative - I recommend going out and buying more memory right away. I got 2GB and the machine blazes! I now use my MacBook as my desktop machine as well - it sits closed behind a 20"" monitor. When I travel, I simply unplug it and go! Highly recommended!"

You can click an icon and have as many widgets as you want on the screen.  The widgets include currency converter, weather, World clocks, stock ticker, BBC radio, etc, ect, etc.  You can downloads 100s of widgets right onto your computer and save yourself hours searching around webpages for the same info.  There is even a flight tracker that will track any flight on Earth, COME ON! It's almost too much to handle but it is so nice to know you can do whatever you want with this thing and use all the native software.  Unless you want to do Photoshop or Word... you know.  The built in camera is brilliant and with ichat (can use with AIM) is awesome! You can video conference without wires and all that.  I travel a lot and am gone for months so the built in camera will come in handy. The Macbook is extremely light yet durable.  The keyboard feels rock solid. And this thing is quick!! I only have 512MB of Ram in it but I will upgrade to 2Gs when I install Photoshop.  If you don't use a lot of graphics software this machine is perfect stock.  So quick. Again, the things that impress me the most are the built in things like all the true-to-life screensavers and desktop images.  So cool. I set the Macbook up to my exact specifications in no time.  And I'm not just talking about my name and that sort of thing.  I changed and customized so many settings and this is the first Mac I have ever used.  Take that Windows.

Hard drive as easy to replace as the RAM is a nice touch- another reason the get the smaller drive and upgrade it later. The remote control is neat- used it for a slide show in keynote (keynote opens my powerpoint shows and has some slicker effects, so it looks like I'll save a couple of dollars there too).

The other caveot - she needed to be able to do her work at home on it.  With the Intel chip in this puppy, 2GB of RAM in it, and running parallels - she's now able to run XP just as fast, if not faster on this laptop as she is able to at work.

It's easy to watch for long periods of time withoutt straining. - The black version (which comes at a slightly higher price) is particularly striking, though all the current configurations have that shiny screen many have been requestiong for so long. - This has a very respectable speed, though maxing out the RAM will really give you the opportunity to enjoy the machine at its best. - Although this laptop has some real power under the hood, heat build-up surprisingly wasn't an issue, even with long sessions. In fact, a long-standing  problem seems to have been solved - that of cursor skittishness caused by heat. I found tracking very smooth under all conditions. - One should be careful wtih the hinge on the MacBook; as long as lift the screen from the edges, you'll have no problems at all. - The black version can accumuulate visible ""greasiness"" on the pad, if that's an issue for you.

I have one major gripe with the black Macbook, however, which is that the materials used (at least in the run from which my Macbook came) pick up grease and wear down with ridiculous ease.  Handling the outside of the Macbook is almost always going to leave noticeable greaseprints, which demand constant cleaning unless you're fine with foregoing the whole point of getting the black Macbook in the first place.  Likewise, the fine-grained texturing on the trackpad and keyboard keys wears down quickly: the trackpad developed a noticeable sheen near the center after only three days of use, and the frequently used keys on the keyboard followed soon after.  I had to buy an iSkin to prevent further wear on the keyboard.  As a new Mac user, I was extremely happy with the overall elegance and performance of the Mac, but problems arising from the materials used prove a continual source of annoyance for me, half a year after I purchased it.  I've owned PC laptops before and never experienced anywhere near the same level of problems with greaseprints and trackpad and keyboard wear. If your primary reason for buying a black Macbook over the white is about aesthetics, I would suggest avoiding the black unless you have a reasonable assurance that the quality of materials used has substantially improved (take a good hard look at the trackpad and keys on the display models in Apple stores, and actually handle the exterior).  Otherwise you may be enjoying the slickness of the black Macbook for the mere two days in which it actually looks new."

I have been converted from a one-time Mac user turned PCer back into a Mac-lover.  I will never buy another PC again.  It's lightweight, powerful and jut the right size.  Transportability is a big + for this laptop.  No lugging that heavy 15 lb monster around airports where EVERYONE can tell I have a laptop to potentially steal. The MAC platform makes digital photography and video such a simple job, as well as posting on the web (no more long hours trying to figure out HTML).  Who has time for that?  I still have a Windows platform on this laptop just in case I need it for school related software.  But I essentially use the MAC side 99% of the time. Great piece of technology.  I will teach my children how to use both platforms, but it is APPLE who will get my money."

Battery life is not outstanding, but workable. Recharging is easy: I usually recharge my ipod the same time I am recharging my notebook battery.  I have not explored all the programs available as yet. At the moment, I just download my photographs and short movies to the hard drive. Surfing is effortless.

These intel MacBooks are really fast compared to any PowerPC books I have used in the past.  The built in iSight is a nice feature and the remote is handy.  If your going to invest in one of these though, I would highly recommend getting the Apple Care protection plan as I have experienced various hardware problems with my iBook.  By that point you might as well fork up the extra money for the black.  The only bad thing about the MacBook is that is gets quite hot.  For those of you with an iBook, be prepared because this one gets even hotter than that.

The features included with it (iSight camera, magsafe connections etc.) made all my friends jealous because their laptops seemed really boring compared to theirs and the black made it look really nice. (Along with the apple on the back that glows when your using it, looks really nice and attractive) And it goes fast, works great. But, it has its downfalls. Personally, I experienced problems importing videos from my camcorder onto the computer. The audio got all choppy and was worthless, basically. I went to the Apple Store (they really take care of you at that place, that's another reason why I would recommend a Mac) and they tested it a bunch of times but ultimately this time I was disappointed and they told me to go try to resend the footage to my camera to transfer to the new computer. Otherwise, they said it might be a hardware problem. I haven't tried importing it again so I don't know but it was irritating to not be able to do that. I would still highly recommend this laptop to any computer savvy person. (Some who don't really understand computers find it hard to comprehend a Mac, which is kind of silly since it's basically like Windows) All computers have flaws (atleast as far as I can tell) and this computer has the features, customer service, and affordability to warrant those little flaws."

528275,A2K57QJJEGSB7R,0,1,20,B000EPLRFI,6/6/2009,2,0,0,Waste of money - the end of a love affair,"I first started using Macs in the late 80's. At work I used a Mac SEII; a funny box like thing. In the early 90's I bought a Mac for my home computer, can't remember the type; one with a separate CPU. Both computers and associated software were miles ahead of any of MS Dos PC computer I used at work. Practically everything about them felt like Apple had a foot in the future and an in depth understanding of what users wanted and how to make it easy. I was an ""Apple-bore"". Anywhere I worked I advocated that we used Apples. In the mid/late 90's I had to buy a PC, I got a Dell laptop, which - I thought - worked adequately. In late 2006 it died. I excitedly started reviewing the current Apple Macs and their spec.s for one I would purchase now I no longer was obliged to have a PC. Following a few trials in Apple resellers this (or its forerunner) was the one I chose. From the word go it was a disappointment. - The software was nowhere near as superior to PC's as it had been in the early 90's in fact the photo management (iPhoto) is considerably second rate in comparison to the what ever crusty photo management I had on the Dell. - The hardware struggled. Multi-tasking is painful; imagine your gran' running a marathon with a rucksac on her back and you begin to get the picture of having say more than two applications open. It has a nice fancy spinning wheel instead of an 'egg-timer' these days - get used to it! You are going to see it a lot. - It is not unusual that the curser just freezes or disappears altogether while the processor is 'thinking about some trivial action or other'. - It frequently loses the wireless signal requiring a restart, even though the wireless is fully operational - iCal and Address book are a poor copy of outlook and unfortunately do not work as well (I am no lover of Microsoft, but you have got to say it how you see it). - The 'Finder' is a second rate Windows Explore functionality that is cumbersome to use and either doesn't respond to mouse clicks or is overly sensitive, so when trying to change the name of a document it will open it instead - repeatedly! - I have also lost count of the number of times during a day when an application spontaneously closes. - After a couple of years the battery power would just deplete; the status bar could be as high as 50% but then BLANK! nothing - all power gone. Put the power cord in and the power is at 0% not 50%. - As the processor is so poor and the Finder functionality is so slow it is often hard to tell whether whether upon clicking on the document/application whether it is opening or not; resulting in either just waiting and nothing happening or losing patience and repeatedly clicking and five(!!) or more documents/applications open. I maybe exaggerating to say that you could cook your breakfast on the bottom of the laptop after it has been on for half an hour or so but not by much. I can quite believe the stories of Macbooks bursting into flames; it is uncomfortable to have the machine on my lap after a while. The first item to break was the cable. The contacts in the magnetic input (a great idea) just stopped conducting electricity. Ok buy a new one - yep I did and had to practically re-mortgage for this rather ordinary piece of nothing. The next thing to self-destruct was the hard drive with ALL of the associated information - no reason, it just died. Not quite so fundamental, ordinary nor simple. If I had to re-mortgage for the cable imagine what I had to do for the HDD?(!!!) Of course the repair shop could only replace a 160GB with a 300GB. Now the single mouse button (a bad idea) is at best on the blink and will need repairing. Watch-out bank manager. None of this includes the day to day frustration of frozen software, having to re-boot all the time and the incompatibility with many other pieces of software. Apple is without a doubt the sexiest brand in IT; it without doubt has the most cool - whatever that means - interface with some of its OS and software; none of which really helps if the basics don't work! Apple - by my experience over the last 20 years - has lost its strategic edge over Microsoft. I can't help but think that some people just ""buy-into"" the hype around Apple and forget to judge it by its merits. I do wonder what Apple would be without iPod(iTunes); probably in a tail-spin with the behemoth Microsoft about to eat it up. Buying a poor product is one thing but what makes it worse is that I use an ugly IBM Thinkpad at work which can do - and does - everything this product can and in most instances does it better. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RECOMMENDED"

That was almost 2 years ago and I LOVE this computer still. I recommend, though, that you purchase the applecare protection plan with this. It is an extra warranty that adds 3 years to the parts and labor warranty. Also, if you live near an apple store, purchase procare. It will get you to the front of any tech support line. I walked in to a store and the wait was about 4 hours. I was at the genius bar in 15 minutes. When my macbook needed a repair, the average time on repairs was 5 days.  It took them 4 hours for mine.  Also, the applecare has more than paid for itself. I think for me, being a student, it was around $80 USD.  I had to get a new battery just yesterday. I walked in, told them what was up, and no questions asked, ""Ok here's your new battery!"" and I walked out. I have had problems with some of the hardware, but the customer support is so good that I honestly don't remember what the problems were. Calling tech support is nice too. It is based out of California so, unlike Dell, you can talk to someone without an accent and they can understand you perfectly.

The wireless connection (Airport) is fully compatible with a, b, and g networks. It works with no problems at home and school. The Mac looks and works great. Overheating is a problem because it gets too hot to keep on your lap and the fans turn on at full blast. If you're thinking of buying a Mac, buy it for the OS. It's intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to use.

I couldn't handle Windows anymore--too many crashes, viruses, and so many other problems...I think it was one of the biggest causes of stress in my life!  Switching to apple was a smart move, let me rephrase that...A BRILLIANT MOVE!  The operating system is amazing and makes Windows look horrible...its so easy to use and everything seems so organized.  The software that comes standard with this macbook is excellent!  iPhoto is awesome!! The camera is pretty sweet.  I have enjoyed the glossy screen so far.  As far as overheating, I havent had any problems...just pick up a notebook cooler to protect it from any heat slow down effects.  I strongly reccomend you purchase extra memory (go for the 1gb upgrade)-you'll be happy you did!  And for the price I think it smart to upgrade to the 120gigabyte hard drive.  After all, if you're looking at paying extra for the sweet black color you probably have some additional cash to fork over for more memory/hard drive.  Here is my little break down list PROS - Compact design - Awesome Screen - Great interface - Great basic software package - I dig the keyboard - Fast in most applications -magnetic adapter -office runs awesome CONS -Running non-universal applications can be a bit slower (e.g., creative suite 2) as the program has to be translated through Rosetta-this will not be such a problem as software will become more universal for intel based macs -it does run hot, but most laptops (in my opinion) do...get a notebook cooler with this purchase ONCE YOU GO APPLE YOU'LL NEVER LOOK BACK!"

Also, my brother got an imac 20' (intel) a few months back, so my review is based on my experience with those two machines. 1- the beginning, the OS change:  I   switched from a HD notebook (very good, I think, in terms of overall performance of the hardware and the robustness) to the PBook  , due to the various overheard things about the mac platform. They were all true, and I'm never coming back. And since my brother got the imac with intel processor, with the abillity to run windows natively, I saw I needed to get an Intel mac.  The search began... 2- The Macbook: I got the latest (as of 01/04/07) and the best of the lineup (a 2.0Ghz Intel core 2 duo proc., 2Gig of Ram, 160Hd.(5600RPM Vs a 200G but 4200Rpm which I think is best)) 3- The opinion:  so far I have it for two weeks, and I can say that it's about 2x faster than my 1.5Ghz G4 Powerbook, when encoding video for Ipod and encoding music in Itunes. The apps take about half of they used to in the Pbook to open, even ""under Rosetta""ones, like Photoshop. The resolution is pretty good for a 13' display, at 1280/800. It gets hot, very hot, but just as hot as my old pbook.  It doesn't give me any worries. The vent wines a bit, but just when the proc. is going for it, and I can live with that. It feels a little bit fragile, but just a little bit.  But I'm comparing it to my 15' HP notebook and my 12' alu powerbook.  And when you balance it with the weight and capabilities of the Macbook it's just a joke.  More than worth it. The OS, oh the OS...  I'll try not to take ""the apple side"" of it, but it's just REALLY another issue.  And i LIKE win XP.  Ilife.  Isight. - finishing: I went to dell.com and made a very similar config (impossible to make it the same).  [...] dell X [...] macbook. - result: Mac OS (plus Ilife and Isight) + Win with bootcamp (free)= no brainer.  I didn't  gave a 5 star because it's made of plastic, but isn't anything else out there?

I purchased a new MacBook in late July, and was wowed by its super-fast performace and all the great features that come with Tiger.  Glossy screen is also excellent. However, after about 8 days it refused to shut down, and went into a hibernation.  I had to leave it for 2 days to exhaust the battery, and then put it on AC power and we were away again.  After that, it ran for 3 days, and then crashed like my old PC.  That was one week ago and it shows no sign of working ever again.  Several calls to Apple's support line to puzzled operators have failed to uncover what is going on.  several attempts to restart and reboot the computer have failed, and other than that they haven't been too forthcoming with positive solutions...  Because I didn't ring them within 10 days of purchase I can no longer get a replacement, thus will need to be without a laptop for some weeks whilst it is serviced.  this is not good news... When you read the discussion forums at Apple.com, it seems the problem is fairly widespread.  So I do advise waiting a little while before buying, though surely they should have picked up a problem like this in testing? A few months wait should see an improved MacBook shipping, or do what I should have done, and spend a bit more to get the MacBook Pro.  Proceed with caution for the next little while!"

As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage.  Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and own many of their products.

The ease of use, performance, and design that is Apple makes me productive, keeps the headaches down, and makes working on a computer fun. Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006, with the introduction of Intel processors inside Macintosh computers. Processor in the new Mac Mini This particular Mac Mini features an intel Core Solo processor, which is the little brother to the Core Duo processor.  The Solo performs strongly, in everyday computing tasks: browsing your photos in iPhoto, using the Internet, sending email, listening to music in iTunes, etc.  In fact, the Solo is a very strong processor.  There is certainly a significant increase in performance over the G4, which was previously included with the Mac Mini.  The performance increase is noticeable in everyday tasks.  I was impressed.  The Mac Mini Core Solo also packs enough punch that I was able to play 720p high definition video, but 1080p was a bit too much for it to handle.  Nevertheless, the G4 could not play 720p smoothly, which so the strong step-up with this machine. Design - The Mac Mini is beautiful.  I just love looking at this computer.  One of the most beautiful computer form factors ever.  You will immediately notice how nicely Apple packages the computer, in an impossibly small box.  It may be a small form factor, but it has a lot of features.  There are plenty of ports too: 4 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, DVI Video out, Audio In, Audio Out. Video Card - The new Mac Mini has Intel integrated graphics, which isn't usually a great feature.  However, it is still a step-up from the graphics on the previous Mac Mini.  The graphics on this machine supports Core Image technology, which the previous Mini did not.  It does share your system's memory, for video memory, which is even more of a reason why you should upgrade this system's memory. Video - The Mac Mini includes a DVI-output connector on the back, which can also output VGA, with the included adapter.  An analog video out adapter is also available, separately.  The DVI and VGA connectors will allow you to connect the Mini to virtually any display. Memory - The Mac Mini has a very capable processor, but you may not realize its full potential with the limited memory in the machine, 512 MB.  Consider upgrading your memory, once your machine arrives.  Other World Computing and Crucial are two companies that sale memory, with online selector tools to easily find the right kind. Applications - Apple does include iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, some board games, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software. iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites. It is important to note this Mac Mini does not include a DVD burner, so the usability of iDVD will not be there, unless you buy an external DVD burner. A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival PowerPoint). Hard Drive- This Mac Mini supports a 60 GB hard drive, which will be sufficient for a lot of people.  You can certainly hold a lot of documents and music on it.  However, you won't fit much video. Combo Drive - The Combo Drive in this Mac Mini will allow you to burn music and data CDs, plus watch DVDs.  However, you will not be able to burn DVDs. PowerPC Applications on Intel Machine If you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your Mac, Rosetta works even better. Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it. Wireless - This Mac Mini includes bluetooth and Airport wireless technologies, standard.  Connect wireless keyboards, mice with Bluetooth, and log-onto the Internet with Airport. Overall, I am very happy with the Mac Mini Core Solo.  It should perhaps come with more memory standard, but it is a very impressive machine. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications.  The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and this one has enough power to get most tasks completed in a very speedy manner. I'm happy with my Intel Mac, and I look forward to continue exploring it in the coming days"

528248,A39FORZ43ESUA5,0,1,5,B000EPWDTC,4/8/2006,1,44,73,Extremely slow and painful to use,"I bought this new Mac mini Core Solo computer thinking it would be better in every way than the last model G4 Mac mini I had bought about 8 months ago. Well it isn't, and not only is it not ""4x faster"", it is many times slower in critical applications. At first the computer will feel fast and zippy, and I thought I made a good purchase. Menus open faster, Safari feels faster, Mail works beautifully--there are a lot of good things about this computer. iTunes works great and scrolling anything is much smoother than the previous minis. However, once I started to do work with the computer, I realized that I couldn't. I timed Microsoft Word once. It took 23 seconds to open. It took 50-70 MB of memory just to open with a blank document. Opening Excel is also slow and also uses 50 MB of RAM. Entourage? It uses a little less, but it is still unacceptable. Once I have my professional apps open (which I am absolutely dependent on), the other apps swap out to disk. So if I am writing a document in Word, not only will the program not keep up with the words I am typing, but when I want to reference a web page, the computer will stall for 10 seconds as Safari is put back into memory. Speed and memory are the biggest problems. The emulated apps (like Microsoft Office) use a ton of processing power and memory--more than this computer can provide. For me, using this Mac mini is extremely painful and it feels like 1992 again, or worse. If you use Photoshop or Microsoft Office, stay away from this computer. I had to return this machine, not because it is a bad machine, but because the emulation of PowerPC apps is horribly slow and inefficient. Another problem is that the main memory is also used for graphics. So you automatically lose 64 MB of RAM to the graphics processor. Add in 3 applications that use 70 MB of RAM each, and 5 other apps that use between 10 and 100 MB, and you have a slow computer. But the problem is not only the lack of RAM. Even opening a context menu in Word takes about 5 seconds. You can see as the screen elements (rulers, toolbars, palettes) are drawn on the screen. I really tried to like this computer... but it is in my opinion the worst computer I have ever owned. It is a big step backwards for Apple, and a terrible user experience, and I want my money back."

Now I have buyer's remorse and I'm starting to look at this thing as an expensive paper weight. At times it is soooo slooooowww that I feel like I'm using a Mac Classic again. I have been a big fan of Apple ever since my first home computer, an Apple IIe. This model, however, is a dog and I'm surprised Apple released such a bug ridden product. I frequently experience program crashes - even with Apple software such as Safari. The Print Manager at times will take off as a runaway process that eats up 110% of  CPU resources according to Activity Monitor. 110% ? Once, I quit ITunes and the program seemed to quit. However, it would reappear for no apparent reason. This happend repeatedly and even a Force Quit did nothing. I would recommend waiting for the next release after Apple has fixed the problems with the machine. If you just want to surf and email, then ok. If you want to do more than this, well caveat emptor."

It has been nothing but headaches so far after recording a full band (using Apple's new Logic software) and having the unit restart every 5 to 20 minutes for the last month! I'm returning it tomorrow. Trust me, if you need a workhorse of a computer, this is not it. It just looks cool."
528245,A1AJSZ44D40V57,0,0,2,B000EPWDTC,7/24/2006,1,13,63,Am I in a horror film?,"I must begin by asking Amazon to provide a ""zero star"" rating, and to please discontinue carrying the apple brand. I have owned Apple computers all the way back to the IIe. I will NEVER buy an Apple computer again, mark my words. I bought a Mac Mini Solo on March 18, 2006 at MacMall. After a couple of weeks I started experiencing very strange crashes, not your typical freezes, but very peculiar frightening kind of crashes. At times the computer would simply lock down, but then it started flickering the screen with thin, horizontal blocks of random colors, sometimes I would get the ""kernel panic message"" which is a message in which the OS dims the screen and displays a big ""power button icon"" and the message ""you now have to restart your computer by holding down the power key"". Sometimes, the computer would simply not start up, and would forever wait on a black screen, even though the power led would be on. Sometimes at startup the CR ROM would begin a back and forth frenzy, and nothing would happen. This was the new ""greatest"" apple. So, after a couple of these, I contacted apple, being that we all get the 'complementary three month Apple""S""care plan'. They began by giving me the typical rundown, beginning by DiskRepair, etc. After the fourth call or so, the instructed me to completely re-install the system. I did basically everything they told me even though I was fairly convinced that the problem lied elsewhere (did I forget to mention I am a Computer Engineer?) but I followed every step of every instruction, once before I had been 'disconnected' for trying to suggest an alternate plan, back when they tried to deny me access to a logic board replacement plan. After everything else had failed, I was instructed to take it to a repair center. I quietly complied. At the time I disconnected the computer, I noticed a crack running in the back of the case of the computer. The computer had never been dropped by me, and I personally installed it on my desk, so where could this crack have come from? I immediately called the again, and was instructed to take it back to the reseller (MacMall). At the MacMall store the manager told me that they had a no return policy, but I was welcome to leave the computer for a repair, aggravated, I told him that I had payed for a brand new computer, and I had gotten one with a cracked case. He insinuated that the case might have been broken by me while trying to install some additional memory (remember I'm a Computer Engineer, I design digital circuits, I can certainly pop a freaking case open if I wanted to, but at any rate I wouldn't do it, I get mighty well payed, well enough to spring for the $40 needed to pay for a dude to co this for me). At this moment I was already speaking with apple care, after a lot of arguing they agreed to replace anything that needed replacing, including the case. ""You will get a new computer, only we can't just get you a new one"" the AppleCare person said. I accepted the terms (I didn't really have a choice), and walked away with a grin on my face. About a week later I got the computer back, and it seemed to work fine. I was in the process of moving overseas, so the ""new old computer"" came just in time to be put in my suitcase to be welcomed in French the next time out. I got to my new place, wired everything up and worked for a while. A couple of days into it, it happened again!! Now my complementary Apple""S""care plan is over, I'm supposed to pay to get the service again even though this is the exact same problem I had been experiencing before!! This piece of junk crashes an average of 5 times a day, and it is doing it in exactly the same way as before. Bottom line: You will get the shaft. Apple has been cutting down the prices on it's products by slashing warranties (and charging you for it later), and downgrading their quality assurance. When I pay for something I expect it to work, and a cool ""we're sorry, but that's your problem"" doesn't cut it. I'm amazed at how the brand has changed from a professional grade product to a teenage oriented cool world of MacGeniuses and MacProduct specialists. And just in case: the Intel processors are not 'superior'. They are a non-scalable 32-bit architecture. Ever wonder why it is that there is no G5 substitute out there yet? Because there isn't one, they can't make something to compete with the monster based on these little chipmunk chips. Faster? nah, I bought the solo so I wouldn't get bogged down with the incompatibilities that will no doubt start to surface with every system upgrade, but I know microprocessor architecture theory well enough to understand that there is no absolute test for speed, specially if you cripple the performance of the old G4 by feeding it code 'optimized' for two chips. Don't buy Apple products. This is a freaking nightmare ."

So, it is the fastest computer I have ever been on.  Now, don't underestamate me, i know alot about computers.  Again, if you are one of you P.C.

I bought TEAC immediately when I heard it at my friend's house - I was sold immeditely. I am an audio-video enthusiast and I have a lot of equipment by Denon, Yamaha, etc.   Unfortunately, dedicated speakers produced for IPOD generally suck.  They are expensive and lack bass. Simple as that.   I own I-Station and I-Home as well so I have something to compare, but, in all fairness, there is simply no comparison.  GR-10i is the best sounding dedicated IPOD device period.  It produces such an incredible bass sound, that I wanted to check my eyes and ears: where is all this bass coming from? They have an interesting system where the bass is coming from under the bottom of the unit - and it works!  The sound fills my living room with no problems.  I also found that best setting for my listening preferences here is ""Treble boost"" on IPOD EQ.  You definately don't need to boost bass, there is plenty of it.  Again, I own Istation and Ihome and I've auditioned every other kind of ipod speakers at the Apple store, including Klipsh Ifis, Boss station, and Apple's own 350$ speaker.  This 99.00$ thing beats them all in sound. Now please lets get real.  If you are looking for alarm clock first, and great sounding Ipod stereo second, this is not for you, get IHome instead.  I mean, this does not have backup battery in it - do you really want to take your chances when the electricity goes off?  Also the front display is large and would probably be annyoing to some as the bedroom alarm.   But if you are looking for the best-sounding dedicated IPOD speaker system out there - run to your local Costco or get it here on Amazon."

Wake feature- awake to radio or IPOD Cons:  PLEASE believe me...display is WAY TOO BRIGHT for use as a bedroom clock-even at the ""dim"" setting.  There is an alarm setting but no snooze button- this is advertised as a table radio NOT an alarm clock; you can use station presets but only access them from the remote; when the radio or IPOD is used for alarm- be prepared to get blasted out of bed-lowest setting is a 10.  It ramps up the volume when the alarm goes off but it happens so fast it's still quite a shock. Great for ""table radio use""  Not so good for clock radio use."

I will say that this radio sounds great, and plays music from my iPod beautifully.  However, others have mentioned before the two fatal flaws in its operation which will keep it out of my bedroom: 1) The volume control works very nicely in digital steps from 0 up to 40, however the timer requires that you set a wakeup volume, and it enforces a minimum of 10, which is way too loud for me.  I still can't believe that Teac would make such an arbitray and stupid decision as this.  Can there be a technical or behavioral reason why Teac engineers would prohibit me from setting a softer volume at wakeup?  Why doesn't the timer just use the existing volume setting that I've already been using and obviously like, instead of overriding it?  I can't for the life of me understand this decision of theirs. 2) No battery backup.  If power fails during the night, all the radio and clock setting are lost within 30 seconds.  Period.  This omission alone I could have lived with as power failures are rather rare, but the blasting wakeup volume I mentioned above I certainly can't live with. However, like I said, I like the radio as a radio and iPod speaker system, so I'm going to keep it for that purpose.  However, I have to wonder about the Teac company - why they put the timer function into a great sounding radio, and then ruined its usefulness.  Very mysterious and stupid of them."

I have tried almost every ipod speaker/clock-radio available in the market this side of BOSE and this baby beats them hands-down in clarity, depth, richness and price. I just love pretty much everything about it especially the convenience of having a full function remote control. My only grouse is with its size, which is a little too big for the nightstand but since we didn't buy it for the nightstand, we are fine with it. The other issue is the build quality. A few days after the purchase, the onboard volume control started acting up. (only increases irrespective of which way you turn it) But since the remote has volume control i am not too bummed about it. Other than that, it is a sure winner. I don't know what that other guy is talking about when he says it hisses or whatever. He probably has a bad unit and should just get a replacement."

I couldn't remove the ipod from the dock smoothly because of the rubber backing that was designed to hold the ipod in place.  Also, the model I purchased didn't come with a remote.  There was only an order form to purchase the remote for an additional $20.  Needless to say, I returned the ihome and purchased the TEAC GR-10i from Costco.  I love it!! Not only does it come with a remote, it fits my nano perfectly.  Although the unit itself doesn't come with a nano adapter, an adapter did come with my nano, which fits perfectly into the unit.  I like the gun metal color and the holder on the back for the remote.  The remote has a nice solid feel to it also.  Although you sacrifice desk space, the sound quality is a lot better.  This unit is perfect for an office.  Unlike the iHome, this doesn't have an alarm feature, but it does have a timer that will turn the unit on at a specified time.  So far...I love it!!"

After some prep work and several coats of the Forever Black Bumper & Trim Dye, I was immensely pleased that my trim was returned to its original deep black color. Multiple Applications --------------------- Depending on how faded the black is, it could take many applications to achieve the deep black color you desire. Be sure to let each application dry thoroughly before putting on another. Once dried, the application of dye may lighten - don't be disheartened; subsequent applications will progressively yield better results. Once you are satisfied with the restoration, leave the dye to cure for at least 24 hours before subjecting it to the elements. Prep Work --------- It is absolutely essential that you THOROUGHLY clean your trim and/or bumper BEFORE you apply the dye on them. The dye permanently adheres only to porous plastic and rubber. To ensure maximum adhesion, be sure to thoroughly clean off any surface dirt and/or any wax residue left by a car wash.  Thorough prep work is necessary to ensure you get the maximum penetration of the dye into the material to be dyed black. Lasting Black ------------- The Forever Black Dye Kit provides a lasting restoration to a deep black color. It's been well over 2 years since I used the Forever Black Dye Kit (the product page Instant Order Update says ""You purchased this item on August 14, 2006"" - that's how I know) and my trims are still as jet black as the day they were restored. Bottom Line ----------- The Forever Black Bumper & Trim Dye Kit works but it may take some elbow grease in prep work and repeated applications before the desired results are achieved. Once applied, the Forever Black Bumper & Trim Dye Kit should keep your black looking black for years to come."

I then masked the adjacent paint and applied 2 good coats of forever black - In all the process took about 2 hours.  The car really looked good then, almost like new.  My impression was, ""cool, this stuff is great!"".  Judging by how difficult it was to clean up the spills, it seemed that it was going to stick and be durable.  However, because I wanted to make sure the ""dye"" had cured, I did not wash the car for about 3 weeks.  Then I used one of those automatic car washes that are at gas station/ convenience stores.  The side trim still looks good but the rear bumper has lost most of the ""dye"" - it just washed off during the first wash!  Maybe your results will be better if you have the time to hand wash your car, but do you really have time to always do that?"

I am still trying to imput all the measurements.  This program is jerky.  Precise measurements are almost impossible.  For example.  When I tried putting the corner tub unit in.  it would either go pass the wall, stop before touching the wall.  If it finally touched the wall it would flip so the entrance was facing the wrong direction.  Pretty much the only way to align items is to zoom in as much as you can, Even then it is almost impossible.  All the bells and whistle, like being able to fly through the house for a visaul representation are not worth getting.  You almost have no control in the way they designed the movement options.  The only way this program should be marketed is free-ware.  It absolutely SUCKS!!!!"

This program lives in some weird fantasy world where kitchen cabinets only come in a few allowable sizes, windows are all custom made, stairs decide their own rise rate, and pocket doors are never placed in walls with other intersecting walls (to name a few).

It looked great and had ""lots of extras"", but there is almost too much detail, for example you cannot just draw a wall, you have to choose what type of material it is made out of and how thick it is.  There is so much detail that it seems more like a high end CAD program than something for a basic home design program.  That would be good if it had some of the features of a high end CAD program... like blueprints, or output to a plotter, but it does not.  The ""cool"" features that make this a ""flashy"" program are such a pain to try to get to work correctly they render themselves worthless, because they are so cumbersome to use.  For the price I am very disappointed.  It is like paying for a Mercedes Benz and ending up with a  car that look good, but has a hamster for an engine and only drives forward and only turns to the left so you spend so much time trying to figure out how to get where you want to be, you end up walking.

Now I need to redesign my kitchen, so I said to myself: why not reuse my old plans in the latest version of this software?  Well after some research in the web I found out that this software has no past and no future.  Starting with V5 all designs with prior versions are not compatible and cannot be opened with newer versions.  And starting with V9, all designs with previous versions are incompatible once again!  Why you ask? Well, it seems that this software package has changed hands several times (from Broderbund, to Cadsoft, to Punch and Encore), and everytime this happened the old name remained but the old customers were abandoned; so you see what I mean by no past and no future.  It appears that Cadsoft now makes a product called ""Envisioneer"" that will open 3DHDv8 files; however, this product costs about 1k!

I used this program as a hobby to visualize my dream home - or really, homes. I have so many that it's hard to pick! It was a little difficult to use this program, mostly because it required so many details, but the final product was EXACTLY what I had envisioned! I can't comment on the blueprints or anything outside of the computer, because I can't afford to build this home just yet.. or possibly ever :( .. so there was no need to print out blueprints or show them to my fiance, but it was a lot of fun to ""build"" my homes on this program!"

One thing I will say right away is that learning this for a newbie can take a little time.  It can be fun, but it is difficult to take a space that is already in existence and build it with the program.  As a person with CAD and design experience, I can say this is something I would use just for fun. My biggest problems are the limitations of what you can create.  Often my houses end up looking too much alike.  Not to say you can't make a good variety of home designs; its just difficult or impossible to take what is in my head and build it with this program.  Some of this is just because the different finishes are nice, but don't fit the interior design schemes I would like to create.  I also have problems with the program randomly freezing, causing me to loose my work.  It seems to happen in spurts.  I also could not get the program to work on my husband's computer at all, and his is newer than mine. All that being said, I have spent many hours creating homes and their interiors.

For the most part, the only difference between this model and previous Series 2 Tivos is the ability to record two channels at once. The box keeps the look of the more recent series 2 Tivos, except for a black-accented faceplate. The connections in the rear are laid out largely the same as past versions, with the exception of an ethernet port that has been added for wired networking. The software has minor changes, particularly slight modifications to the menu background images and the newer ""tivo introduction skit"" that appears when the tivo is powered on. The software and hardware work smoothly. There seems to be a faster processor included, as navigation through the menus is quick and smooth. The dual-tuner functions work well. Having grown accustom to the single-tuner model, it took me some time to get used to the ability to change channels while recording (and that what is on screen is not necessarily what is being recorded). It was also pleasant to schedule 25 season passes without a single conflict-such is the benefit of being able to record two shows at once. But the dual-tuner function needs some explanation. The people who benefit most from the DT function are those who have analog cable without a cable box (as I do). I simply plug in the coax cable into the tivo, and it is ready to go. (Note: there is only one coax input-the signal is split internally and sent to the dual tuners.) If you have a cable box or digital cable, things start to get a bit trickier. In fact, in order to use the dual-tuner feature, you MUST be able to receive at least some channels through an analog cable connection. This means that if you have purely digital cable that requires a digital cable box, you will NOT be able use the dual tuner functions, as there is only one connection allowed between the cable box and tivo. I suggest you go to tivo's website and download the product manual for the DT tivo and read the part about connecting tivo to your cable. If it seems like too big of a hassle, you might want to wait for the series 3 tivos that will include cable-card technology (which allows you to use digital cable without the cable box). One additional note, tivo has stopped supporting over-the-air antenna tuning with this model. If you hook up an antenna to tivo, it will only receive channels 2-13. Any broadcast channels above 13 will not be received. And for those who are thinking of ""upgrading"" this tivo to a larger hard drive-the DT tivo is upgradeable in the same ways that past series 2 models were. I used the standard methods (which are published all over the internet) and replaced the 80GB hard drive with a 250GB one. Upgrading, however, voids your warranty (which is only 3 months anyway). Overall, I am happy with the DT tivo, but that is in large part due to fact that I receive analog cable without a cable box. Many of you who have been using antennas, cable boxes or digital cable will likely be somewhat less satisfied with this model."

The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the second of the ""dual-tuner"" channels working. After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service. As it turned out my RF input was not working properly; however, I found out something extremely important. New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009. Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now, and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the ""dual channel"" system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment. I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it."

The Tivo can record 2 programs while we watch a pre-recorded program and it allows networking with wired or wireless computers via Tivo Desktop.  You should expect to pay about $100/year for the channel guide service.  Tivo currently has a 3 years for the price of 2 promotion.  This means that 3 years of service cost about $300. Tivo desktop allows us to transfer files from the Tivo to the larger hard drives in our computer thus extending the 80 hours on the Tivo to over 200 hours.  In addition, Tivo desktop allows us to watch programs on our computers anytime we want. Tivo to Go is a new feature of the Tivo desktop software.  For $24.95, Tivo desktop will convert standard Tivo files for playback on PDAs, cell phones and other handheld devces. The only down sides are the quality of the tuners and the remote control.  We clearly see a difference in the picture quality between our TV's tuner and the tuners on the Tivo.  The second issue is the remote will not control our Bose surround sound system. The convenience of the DVR off-sets the quality of the tuners and a third party remote will fix the second problem. I hope you enjoy your Tivo as much as we enjoy ours."

Pro: -Our TV no longer owns us... we can go to dinner without rushing back home to catch ""How I Met Your Mother"" or ""Two and a Half Men"" -Easy to use to play, pause, rewind... also easy to find and record shows -Easy to program to record all upcoming shows -Holds lots of programs (I think at one time we had fifty or so shows recorded on high-quality) -No internet connection required -Easy set-up, even on Christmas when we bought the unit (I was very impressed) -Deleted shows go into a deleted items folder and are deleted later... nice if you delete something accidentally because you can get it right back Con: -Our Tivo now owns us -Not obvious way to tell how much memory has been used -Tivo forces mail (via Tivo) as well as updates that can change features and have also send us some junk advertisements -Customer service will take you through a grueling 2-hour troubleshooting process if you think your unit is broken... it required several call backs where I waited on hold a very long time.  I was also hung up on when in the middle of troubleshooting when the tech realized the call center had just closed -We had to pay about $50 to ship the unit back to Tivo for repair despite being under warranty (Tivo does not reimburse you for this) -You must record ads and must fast-forward through them -Tivo will make recommendations, adding as many as 20 programs a day (theoretically it could at up to 48 shows that you'd need to clean out) -Can only record one show at a time -Set up is slow, lengthy -A larger unit that we had expected... hoping future versions are smaller or integrate a DVD player to eliminate cords -If you buy the lifetime package, if you buy a new Tivo, or if your old one breaks and cannot be repaired, you will need to buy another lifetime package or a monthly subscription... lame! Neutral: -You need to keep Tivo connected to a telephone line (I suppose you could leave it connected only part of the time, but that's not convenient) Bottom line: We think that it is currently the best unit on the market, but we are desperately hoping to get a different one from another company.

Be sure to buy yourself a nice long Ethernet cable if you are planning to hook it up to your router. (Unless you are one of those people who have the router right next to the tv - then buy a short one). Three points that ding the rating on this Series 2: 1. The Dual Tuner is joke, you need to jump through a whole series of button clicks to get it to work.  Not intuitive at all - you will find yourself reading the manual a number of times in the hopes of getting it right. 2. You can't hook your DVD player up to the TIVO!  This means that if you only have one set of input jacks on your TV, that you will need to either buy and S-Cable for your DVD or continuously switch the DVD & TIVO back and forth.  What is upsetting, is that the TIVO has input jacks, but doesn't allow the signal from the DVD to get routed through. 3. Finally we did get some hiccups in the volume when we first set it up, but these have magically disappeared. To summarize, base TIVO functionality is really good, but there are some fine points that need to be worked on to make this a 5-Star product."

No more conficts between my Season's Passes this year... Guided setup can now be done via network adapter instead of the previous mandatory dial up via phone line.  Initial setup is A LOT faster because of this. The menu movement and channel changing is snappier, which is nice. Network transfer speed using the Tivo Wireless Adapter is almost 2X as fast as my single tuner model. I had to upgrade Tivo Desktop from 2.2 to 2.3 because transferred recordings had no sound on my PC.  The upgrade fixed it. Recording two shows at the same time is easy and works great!  What I like even better is when you are recording a scheduled show, you have the ability to channel surf on the Tivo without that annoying message ""Are you sure you want to change channels, or leave it here and keep recording"" coming up. The remote is exactly the same.  The back of the Tivo is the same except for the addition of an ethernet port, which I have not tried to use since I use wireless. I highly recommend this Tivo for new customers, and as a replacement for Tivo veterans."

We really like the fact that Tivo gives us back 15 minutes out of every hour of commercial programming by allowing us to skip over commercials.  That in itself is worth the price - and we do not watch much TV. Tivo rebate program is easy, quick and well-run. Tivo remote works very well and is well made. THE BAD Our decision to purchase Tivo was influenced by the availability of Tivo Desktop. I am technically savvy, understand networks, protocols and have been able to get just about any device or application up and running on a network.  Tivo Desktop (running on WinXP) is a major source of frustration.  I have tried ALL support remedies, and no relief.  After original install, I could upload programs from Tivo to my PC, but viewing through Windows Media Player was scrambled. Upgraded WMP, codecs, tried other players, other codecs, uninstalled Tivo Desktop, reinstalled, rebooted Tivo, reassigned IP addresses - EVERYTHING - and now I cannot even see Tivo from Tivo desktop and vice versa.

I had a bit of a problem with the connections, largely because it had to fit into a small space in our entertainment center along with our VCR/DVD player, since we still have many tapes we need to watch and want to be able to play DVDs.  The poster did not mention how to connect the VCR, so I disconnected some things that should have remained connected, and then had trouble with the coaxial cables.  It took about an hour, but our furniture setup was largely to blame.  There should be something on the poster to warn folks with VCRs or DVD players to go right to the appendix of the printed manual and skip the poster. Once it was hooked up, though, it was a breeze to register and set up.  We are still on a learning curve, but we were blown away when on the third day we had friends over and were recording two shows at once while at the same time showing a slide show of our vacation photos from off our two computers.  Zapping through the ads is so great now, and when you push the play button, it backs up just the right amount to account for the overshoot.  No more tracking problems with the tapes.  As another reviewer said, this is the way TV was supposed to be. Edit 12/15/07 ***** After 6 months we still love our TiVo.  Sometimes the initial love affair with a new widget dies after a little usage, but not here.  We have had no problems with it whatsoever. (I don't like the little advertising icons in the Now Playing list, but just don't click on them and they'll leave you alone.)  We continue to find new ways to use the TiVo.  For example, I just joined MovieLens, a site that makes movie recommendations for you based on your ratings of movies in their database and they produced a Wish List for me, mostly of movies that came out several years ago.  I entered that wish List into TiVo and when any of those movies appear on TV it will record them.  I just did this a few days ago and so far none of those movies have come on.  The picture is crystal clear, the network connection has been perfect, and I transferred a TV show that I had recorded to my PC so that I could discuss some of the finer points via e-mail with a friend who is a fan of the same show.  It was great to be able to zip right to a particular scene to compare notes.  This is cool technology."

I was amazed in doing my research that a TIVO subscription is almost half of what the local cable company wanted to charge me.  In addition I found out that TIVO is by far a superior product to what the cable company offered. I definitely have been missing out all these years without TIVO.  Just a normal night last night for example, the phone rang while I was watching TV.  I paused the TV, and then continued several minutes later when I got off the phone.  Then I was able to skip commercials after that. I was worried about the installation (Not very technically inclined), but that went very smooth.  All that was required to do was to hook up the cable to the TIVO, the cable from TIVO to the TV, and the power cord.  The rest was done right on screen and in less than 15 minutes, I was enjoying the new experience.  I even was able to hook the TIVO up to my wireless network at home. Truly a great product and I have been telling everyone since I got it how great it is.

Our cable recorder was not reliable at all.  It didn't record all of the shows we set up and sometimes you couldn't access the shows that it did record.  It has been wonderful using our new TiVo!!  It has been 100% reliable with recording and playing shows.  With our wireless adapter, TiVo connected easily with our computer, where we can access our digital movies, images, etc. The TiVo on-screen menu is very user-friendly and there are plenty of videos from TiVo to help get you acquainted with many of its features.

The change was mainly since tivo's now have a small initial cost ( there's usually a tivo rebate available ), so I might as well get the the extra space and the extra tuner. The upgrade was very noticeable; almost immediately I wondered how I ever got by with just the single tuner.  During prime time I would often have to miss one show in order to record another, that problem is now solved.  Additionaly being able to watch something else while the tivo records just adds to the control you have over when you watch something. I now have the old tivo in my bedroom, connected wirelessly to the new one.  I'm able to watch something off of the dual tuner on the single tuner as its transfering, however it isn't fast enough to be able to fast forward more than a couple minutes, so you're going to get the commercials in that case.  Not a big deal, and not tivo's fault.  Occasionally I have to unplug and replug in the wireless transmitter ( purchased seperately ) to get a higher transfer rate, but I'm not certain if that is the tivo or adapters fault."

I've gotta say, TiVo wins, hands down.  You pay more for the service, and you have to buy the box (cable companies ""loan"" you the box), but they make sure it's worth it.  They have to, to continue to compete. One big, BIG plus:  Internet content.  If you connect to the TiVo service over a broadband internet connection, you can download videos from the internet and watch them directly on your TiVo.  Even better, you can transfer your recorded TV programs to your PC using TiVo Desktop. The show rating system and viewing pattern recognition work really well.  I haven't even watched anything of the sort yet, but it recorded an episode of Mysterious Journeys set in a haunted prison.  That's just the sort of thing I love (it turned out to be a lame program, but I don't blame TiVo for that).  It also recorded the Daily Show, making me realize that I still needed to set up a Season Pass for that show. Lots of options on how to record shows and how long to keep them, plus great extras like live weather and games make this a worthy purchase. For added value, you can purchase your service package up to a year in advance, and get a better rate.  Plus, you pay once and don't worry about a monthly bill all year. (IF YOU CAN, BUY REFURBISHED.  I DID, FROM AMAZON, SAVING A L-O-T OF MONEY, GOT FREE SHIPPING, AND I FOUND OUT FROM A TIVO TECHNICIAN ON THE PHONE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A BRAND NEW UNIT!)"

The product is really easy to use and this 80 hour version has plenty of space for a whole house to be happy because the recorder lets you prioritize the shows you record with the season pass manager by not only order and number of shows kept, but also recording quality so shows like Full House don't dominate your memory!

It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv.  The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections.  This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems.  (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective).  As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"

I am very happy with it - the dual tuner is a great improvement - its nice to not get stuck with watching what you are recording always.  I am running this with a wireless connection via the Tivo wireless G adapter, connected to my home network on Verizon FIOS - so much faster then the phoneline connection for program updates etc.  Overall very happy with the unit. Pros:  Has an ethernet port built in, no more blinding blue tivo logo that was always on ( much appreciated)and the unit is faster. Cons:The hard drive is noisy - and the buttons on the remote wear quickly - also could use a lighted remote.  They are not quick with the rebates."

The set up was not too bad, just a little tricky with the DVD, VCR and all, but we got that working.  We rarely ever get to sit down and watch a show at its actual start time, so with the new fall season shows, TIVO has been a lifesaver!  I don't know how we lived without it!"
528186,A1MLI1RQ4KLVAN,0,1,115,B000ER5G58,6/17/2008,4,2,2,"Great Product, but not perfect...","I finally switched from ancient antenna to basic cable, so I decided to get a Tivo.  I don't watch much television, but there are a few shows I like and figured this would work out perfectly for me and my family.  Initial setup was pretty simple and I did not run into any problems until I hooked up the Tivo to my phone line.  It would not connect to the server to finish the initialization process.  Luckily I was able to move my router to accomodate a network connection which worked fine, however, it did take awhile.  Once I got it up and running, it was great being able to schedule all my recordings and use the season pass feature.  I also setup my computers with the Tivo desktop to be able to put programs on to my hard-drive for future viewing.  I was pretty disappointed to find out I have to spend an additional $25 to upgrade to Tivo desktop plus to be able to convert the videos into .mp4 format.  I have not yet upgraded to Tivo Desktop Plus, but probably will, just so I can convert and edit the TV shows that I want.  My other complaint is I feel that with all the technology there is, the User Interface is just too slow.  Mainly, when I am trying to modify settings on a season pass or startup.  Hopefully, on the newer models they will use a little more processing power and get up to date with current pc's.  Although, cable and satellite dvr's aren't necessarily any better in these areas.  Lastly, it is ridiculous that this model only has an 80gb hard-drive, and to go larger there is a huge jump in price.  The base model should start off at a minimum of 120gb, especially with the drop in prices on hard-drives.  Other than that, Tivo is everything it claims to be and once you have it you will never want to go back to regular tv again.  I love the fact that I don't have to worry about missing a show, and I can pause and rewind live tv.  And the best part is fast-forwarding through commercials."

So glad TiVo came out with the dual recording capabilities on their stand alone (without Direct TV) equipment.  My only suggestion would be:  that they would indicate on the ""Guide"" what channels are going to be recorded (Time Warner had this feature).  TiVo is far superior to any of the other two recorders I have used.  TiVo's customer service also deserves ***** stars.  The only problem I have is that I now watch to much television."

Our VCR was fine, but I was the only one who knew how to program it. I had to keep track of where things were on the tape, and help me if there was more than one thing to record. We've had a TiVo for a couple of months now, and I've started to forget when shows are on. I can come back from a walk with my family, and start watching a show that's halfway through recording, or watch a show while another is recording. But one of the biggest selling points is the simple interface. Everyone in my house can find the show they want to watch (no scanning for it on the tape), and start seeing it within a few seconds. One of the few nitpicks is that the 80 hours refers to recording at the most basic quality, which is barely passable for video. At the next level, it can store slightly under 40 hours. Even this sounds like a lot, until you realize how many movies are on TV. This is truly a minor thing, but it's very hard to find fault with this device."

Because I have a cable provider for my telephone hookup, I needed to purchase a TIVO wireless network adapter.  It is less expensive to buy it through Amazon -- I went to Best Buy and paid $20.00 more. I now download some shows to my laptop and then watch them while I do dishes or am cleaning the house."

Features like the new search, netflix and youtube. Maybe even some more new features will be missing by the time you read this. TIVO is not interested in making these features available to pre Series 3 boxes either. After all they need to make a profit from new hardware sales and subscriptions. Second, as I learned in a previous review, the second tuner is not digital capable which means unless you have a cable company, you may not be able to use the second tuner. Finally if you get a lifetime subscription, be aware that in a few years when TIVO adds more features but neglects the older boxes, you cannot transfer your lifetime subscription to a new box (unless TIVO changes their policy, or makes an exception). So what have we learned? Instead of buying this now ignored-by-TIVO tuner you should buy the newer Series 3 for much more $$ and not get the lifetime subscription so you can transfer you service in the event you upgrade in the future."
528178,A2Y6U3BZSVPLGZ,0,1,107,B000ER5G58,7/22/2007,5,6,8,"Don't believe all that you read, Tivo is great, period.","Ok, by now you have read all the Tivo lovers spout off about how much they love their Tivo's. I feel the same, I love my Tivo's. I want to dispell the misinformation of some others who don't know what they are doing,and who have let that cloud their view of Tivo. Tivo can record from Satelite and cable. If the Tivo is dual tuner, it can record from cable and satellite at the same time. A single tuner can record from cable, or satellite, and be connected to both at the same time, but only watch, or record one channel. One tuner, equals one channel at a time, there is no two ways about that. The misinformation is in thinking that a single tuner, or duel tuner can not work with both cable and satellite. I have basic cable going to the RF port, and satellite going to the S video input. The Tivo setup will walk you through the setup, so it can't be any easier. Cable channels show up with cbl afterthem, and satellite channels with sat. They appear in the program guide on their correct channel numbers. I have used Comcasts PVR, and built my own using Beyond TV. The Beyond TV machine was as close to Tivo as I could hope to get, and better in a few areas. The main drawbacks on the home built box with Beyond TV was the cost, and the noise. I had a duel tuner in my home built system, and it worked very well. I just could not get the thng to be quiet and cool at the same time. My Tivo's are quiet, I have two in the bedroom, and can not hear them. The lifetime service I bought back in 2001 has paid for itself many times over. I just got to upgrade to a duel tuner and transfer my lifetime to it. Tivo is a first class act, right from customer service, to customer policy, and equipment design and funtion. Nobody beats Tivo at their game.  Many have tried and failed. You may become use to your Comcast PVR, but if you try Tivo, you will never want anything else."
528177,A1X3DA7C61WZLQ,0,1,106,B000ER5G58,7/27/2009,2,1,1,Not really a dual tuner,"I thought I had read everything about this model of TiVo to understand that it is a true dual tuner DVR, but it isn't one.  It is a very clever if not misleading engineering feat to achieve dual-tuners on this TiVo, but the way they did it defies understanding.  The TiVo digital transition pages on their web site state that as an owner of a TiVo Series 2 DT, I do not need a converter box to view ATSC digital transmissions.  This is fine since I now use FiOS.  The problem is that I mistakenly understood this implication that the TiVo Series 2 DT works with QAM over cable.  In fact, the Series 2 DT does NOT support QAM over cable and probably requires a converter box for over-the-air ATSC as well. The problem for my needs is that my Verizon FiOS service has NO analog channels at all.  The ""DT"" feature of the TiVo Series 2 DT implies that the second tuner can receive basic cable, but that's not true for FiOS and a growing number of digital cable subscribers.  What it doesn't make totally clear to you is that the second tuner can only receive ANALOG, UNSCRAMBLED basic cable. If you're buying this and you have FiOS or Comcast then you are effectively buying a single-tuner DVR.  However, this might not matter, because even if this machine did support digital QAM channels, only lifeline basic cable is unscrambled.  In fact on FiOS my HDTV tuner tells me that only the local channels and the music channels are actually unscrambled on Verizon FiOS. This is a clever and not completely honest marketing technique.  They're not lying to you but they are not making enough of an effort to clarify what the dual-tuner can do without digging endlessly through the TiVo knowledge base or some of the many online communities.  The ""Digital Transition"" information at TiVo's web site implied that the ""DT"" mark on the TiVo Series 2 DT meant ""Digital Television."" Now for the use of the TiVo itself, it's great, and I've used it for ten years, but the analog S-video connection between the Motorola FiOS set top box and the TiVo produces vertical ""hum bars"" which require a lot of trial-and-error to eliminate. You should get the Tivo HD instead of this.  I'm frustrated with FiOS and the Tivo Series 2 DT and I don't frustrate so easily with electronics like this."

The Tivo Series 2 is just that. True, it doesn't stream Netflix movies and it isn't in HD, but that's OK, because I don't subscribe to Netflix and I don't have HD TV. Plainly said, the Tivo Series 2 makes my families life easier.  It records what I set it to record without problem, whether I set it from my computer or the Tivo box itself.  It even records programs under Tivo Suggestions that I maybe interested in, which often times I am.  The Series 2 allows me to watch exactly what I want to watch whenever, and its great.  Often times I will come from work at 1 AM and watch the Simpson re-runs I love, the Colbert Report, Daily Show and maybe an episode of Malcom in the Middle.  My wife love watching Sci-Fi shows, Jon & Kate Plus 8, The Real Housewive of Oranage County and Highlander.  We have totally opposite tastes, but we rarely fight over what to watch on TV because of the Series 2.  It has been a real life changer. Not to mention the features of the Amazon.com Unbox service where you can purchase or rent movies and then download to your Series 2, and it has worked great for me. Of course being able to pause live TV while you are watching a movie so that you can go to the bathroom.  The interface is easy to use and setup. You get the most for your money and your cable subscription because you are able to record programs up to two weeks in advance, and of course you can change it any time. Great product."

I have all three sith broadband wireless connection and all three will show what i have recorded and available on the others. Amazon had (at time of purchase) for 65.95 after $150 rebate so as far as my needs are, this was a steal - excellent bargain.  I always check Amazon first for any electronics purchase.

After 2 months of straggle, I finally got Tivo since there is no alternative option left. After I play around with Tivo for 3 hours, I already have at least 10 season passes lined up on my Tivo and I am starting to worry I will be out of recording space soon. Tivo is addictive and amazin.

I also wish there were an easy way to find out how much storage you're using and how much you have free (at least I haven't found that option yet!).

With no CD input one had no alternative but to use a TIVO tested device and aside from the actual TIVO adapter a number of the other recommended adapters were hard to find.  Fortunately I found a D-Link adapter source after searching the net.  I also found TIVO support inadequate when I wanted to ask a 'warm body' about the rebate.  After dialing the initial 800 # and being redirected to what I hoped would be a real person I got a message saying that I could not access from my location (Canada ???).  One final point, I find that TIVO are somewhat mysterious about some of their codes.

528157,A1DBGH53YCX9OD,0,1,86,B000ER5G58,8/29/2007,3,17,25,Take the good with the bad...,"1. First, don't even try it with analog cable, digital cable is a must. Even then I wouldn't use Tivo to watch ""live"" tv, get a splitter and use another input on your tv. Secondly, you'll have to keep the Tivo on best quality recording to get something that resembles the actual broadcast, which brings the actual recording time down to 22 hours. That was a little disappointing, but honestly, if I ever need more than 44 shows to watch at once, I've got bigger problems. 2. To make up for less recording time the PC software has been great for archiving, but you really need a PC dedicated to tivo. Storage is almost 1 gig per 30 min show, and it takes almost that long to transfer (I schedule it to transfer while I'm at work or late at night). After that, DRM is kind of a bummer (because your transferred show is now a .tivo file), but it's alot better than dozens of tapes or dvds with no labels. 3. The online program scheduling is convenient (especially when you forget when the season starts), but it's not something I use everyday.

I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after. Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?

It is easier to have a root canal than dealing with their customer service department.   Once turn on you will have to cancel your credit card to have them stop charging it.

If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box, chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device. I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo, with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor, similar to my VCR and TV. My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound.  The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal. I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround.  However, on TiVo's own website in the customer forum, I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround. This appears to be a design flaw."

We did not realize before buying this that it isn't completely compatible with all satellite/cable systems.  The dual tuner functions don't work with DirecTV so you can't record two shows, or watch one show while recording another.

I love the interface. It's very user friendly, has lots of great features and the suggestions have been surprisingly on target. The product itself is pretty great. Unfortunately that's where the good news ends. Everything went swimmingly until Tivo simply stopped recording. After a few days and many restarts it recorded everything except suggestions. Suggestions was a major reason I picked Tivo over other machines. I did some searching online and found out this was a wide spread issue that the company was completely ignoring. It was about six months before it magically righted itself one day. There was never any acknowledgment from the company of any problem. Things were good for about a year after that. Then the hard drive died. My warranty has of course expired, so there is nothing the company can do except offer to sell me another machine at full cost. They don't offer repair, and I can't recoop any of the cost of the remaining time on my three year service contract. Overall, I love Tivo when it works.

Finally I got a good deal on Amazon ($185 with $150 rebate) and bit the bait. What the heck, it would only cost me $30 plus a year's programming ($129). Well I am hooked. My wife, who was very skeptical of it ( based on my previous attempts) was pleasantly surprised to see that it was so easy to program and watch events. The picture quality is very good. Sometimes a different program records but it may be due to Dish switching the programming in the last minute. If the disk gets full often I will buy a larger 500 G disk and replace it.

I was treated with great patience and kindness, despite my extreme lack of competence with this type of thing.  The next two calls (to get the TIVO wireless USB adapter connected to the internet) were much less helpful, but the fourth call set everything straight quickly.

I prefer using the TiVo DVR to the DVRs my local cable company rents. One of my favorite features is that when you fast forward or rewind, this DVR compensates for that split second it takes from the time you recognize the end of a commercial and the time you release the fast forward feature. TiVo builds in a slight ""jump back"" feature, which the Comcast's DVRs don't have. I also like the TiVo Desktop software which I've installed onto my home computer. With my home network, I can transfer shows from the DVR to my computer's hard drive."

Watching one live show while recording another was a real pain.  My only complaint with this Tivo is that the subscription plans are going up in price and may end up being out of reach for our budget. We're able to swing it now, but if they raise the rates next year I'm not so sure. I'd still rather own the Series3 HD unit, but since I'm not upgrading my cable service anytime soon, this was a fine investment.

Now we really do watch only what we want and we get to watch it on our schedule.  Having said that, the reason I did not give it five stars is the setup is quite an undertaking.  The hooking it up wasn't too bad, but the oodles of menus that follow take a while, and when we got to the part about linking it into our wireless network it went over our heads.  We still have yet to get that feature to function.  Even after you purchase separately the wireless network adapter, it seems as though the network itself must be set up in a pretty specific way.  Luckily you can still do it through the phone line as well or we would be up a creek.  Overall I would say that TIVO makes me happy."

As someone who travels a great deal, a DVR is a virtual necessity if you watch any shows regularly. But the additional features of TiVo were fantastic surprises: it automatically records shows that I might like based on ones that I already watch; it lets me record shows by specifying favourite actors, keywords, or subject matter; it also lets me reprogram the DVR remotely over the web. These are all features that my cable company couldn't touch. The additional features, like the ability to see Yahoo! weather and traffic, access online services, and extend through the TiVo SDK are icing on the cake.

Tivo told me that I could upgrade to a Tivo HD but, again, I would have to do this at full price.  So the bottom line is that Tivo doesn't provide any discounted upgrade options for customers.

Overall, Tivo was much more polished but the Dish DVR was free with my order.  I missed some of the Tivo features (like accurate TV listings ;-) but survived for several years with the Dish DVR.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the new daylight savings rules and mysterous lockups after a recent Disk DVR upgrade.  After trying everything I could think of, searching the Internet, and every wiping the DVR, nothing worked so I called Dish and was given the solution after a 20 minute phone call.  They couldn't explain my lockups or my why the DST info wasn't on their webpage. Back to Tivo - I was pleased with the ethernet connection (painless) and the dual tuners (record one channel on basic cable while recording another channel).  Setup was painless as well. Now a rant - Tivo simply has to reduce their monthly fee.  Many cable companies, Direct TV, Disknetwork, etc have a DVR and despite glowing reviews like this one, most new customers will be driven by price. How do you qualify ""more polished"" until you've used a Tivo? Just a satisfied customer -  no connection with Tivo. Mike Honeycutt"

That was just a minor irritation, I had guessed there would be one...just not quite so high. Much worse, neither was there any mention of the fact that if you have a DSL computer connection that the TiVo will not be able to communicate over your telephone line, as it is supposed to.  DSL phone service introduces some mostly inaudible noise, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio below the level the TiVo can tolerate.  So after 'fessing up to the fact that it probably will not work for you, the TiVo folks tell you to connect it to your computer. So I bought a wireless router and set up a laptop next to the TiVo.  But the connection wire they supply was inappropriate for the computer.  At this point I called DISH and asked how much their integrated receiver/digital recorder went for...and the answer was WAY less per month than TiVo, and $49 for the unit rather than $230.  The TiVo went back (Amazon was great about the return), the DISH unit came and was set up and running in 30 min. Now we are recording all the US Open tennis matches, etc., and are happy as clams.  Maybe we don't have all the TiVo bells and whistles, but for our needs the DISH system is the way to go.  Programming is super simple and it has a 100+ hr.c capacity.  Way more than we really need.  My main gripe with TiVo is that they should have told me about the potential problems, why make me struggle with it at home for several days before realizing I'd been a dunce? Be warned."

Unless you buy a subscription from Tivo (what for?) and pay monthly fees of $12.95/mo or $129 per year or $299 for 3 years or $399 for the rest of already not new, rather 4 years used box - the box is DEAD. I mean it - it's a box which cannot be used for anything... The box has very limited functionality even provided you purchased a subscription from Tivo (I did) - because today all cable providers including Verizon FIOS already moved to fully digital channels - therefore you may view only ONE channel at a time... Absolutely, absolutely useless purchase... Well, I [sorry for my stupidity] cannot figure out what the Tivo subscription for unless you can use the unit as two channel DVR?

Well, if Tivo offered some low, one time ""unlocking"" fee, somewhere within 30 bucks, just to be able to use an ALREADY OLD box as a media device [without being able to record from TV/cable inputs] - well... then yes, I might consider it fair and pay it to be able to use the box... otherwise - I'm sorry - I must qualify the ""business"" that Tivo ""provides"" for used boxes as a pure raping of people who get caught thinking that they can use Tivo devices for anything advertised these devices ""can do"". No, this is a big LIE, the devices are DEAD unless you pay Tivo the raping ""subscription"" fees for nothing in exchange. I do admit that Tivo used to be a good, advanced company which invented the whole idea of DVR, but since then they have done nothing for consumers nor industry itself... Since about 4 or 5 years ago - everything they did had been obsoleted by cable/satellite companies.

You will not get surround sound; you will get poor channel separation (also known as monaural sound).  I replaced an old VCR that chewed up tapes, but still tuned in to channels and had excellent sound reproduction.  When I plugged in the Tivo, the ambience collapsed down to the center speaker in my home theater setup. The Tivo connects to my audio/video receiver.  I have a 20-year-old JVC VCR also plugged in to the receiver.  When I tuned the VCR and the Tivo to the same channel, and switched back and forth, the Tivo seemed to have swallowed all the spatial qualities that (for me) vastly enhance viewing.  The Tivo sound reminded me a lot of my answering machine. One more thing, I had a very poor phone experience with a Tivo technician.  First he tried to have me rewire the connections to my receiver.  I indicated that I did not feel like lifting my 60-pound device and playing with some of the 10,000 cables that were attached.  In any case, the sound was fine before the Tivo (and after, now that I have replaced the old VCR), so the receiver setup was not the problem. Then he suggested that I plug the Tivo directly into the TV (another 20-year-old device, a Trinitron, which only serves as a monitor in my setup).  Just to be cooperative, I complied.  The technician asked if I was getting stereo sound.  I tuned to a music station and tried to detect a difference, but I told him both speakers sounded the same.  He clearly was trying to get rid of me when he said that the problem was my TV, and that I needed to get the TV manual and find out about the specifications.  I was trying to point out that sound into the TV was largely irrelevant, when I noticed that the stereo light on the TV was not lit up.  In other words, the TV was not getting stereo signals.  After I said that, there was a moment of silence, and then he just hung up on me. Somehow, I expected a little more.  Just tell me that this model won't work for me, and suggest one that will."

It copied programs, provided a program schedule, provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose. If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the  selective recording, ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged. So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually, if there was ever any over time it always cut it off. Well no, if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor.

This was a gift, so I listed myself as the purchaser and the recipient as the subscriber. TiVo immediately distinguished itself by notifying the recipient that I had bought them a gift. I successfully got them to delete that email without reading it, but TiVo continued to send them lots of updates about the status of the order, the shipment date, etc. I called to cancel, and was given to a cancellation specialist (interesting that this is an actual job there, isn't it?) so I could get the order cancelled. Surprise! I couldn't cancel the order, but he advised me to put up a sign refusing the order. Unfortunately, he didn't tell me that it would be coming, not from TiVo, but from some fulfillment center in Texas. Naturally, since I hadn't put up a note to refuse a shipment from that location, it got through. I was then told to take the product, on my own time to a UPS center and send it back. What I didn't realize at the time was that this was also going to be on my dime. Still, I was happy just to get rid of the thing. Three days AFTER I took it to UPS and shipped it -- which was itself two days after the unit was erroneously delivered -- I was told a prepaid shipping label was awaiting me at some UPS center, identified only by number, not address. At this point, more than a week after TiVo notified the gift recipient that the return had been received, I am waiting for my money back, during which time I am also paying interest for the outstanding funds. So, the outcome was that they notified the recipient of a gift I was giving (despite everything in the order talking about it being a gift), I had to pay for the return, I had to use my car and my gas and my time to return the item, I get to pay interest on money they still haven't returned, and I still have to buy a gift. Since they couldn't be bothered to return the funds promptly and I couldn't afford to buy things without those funds available to me, I missed out on the Black Friday specials on similar items. I figure TiVo will have cost me a couple hundred bucks when all is said and done -- assuming I ever actually get my money back. If you care about getting actual customer service, don't buy from these people. The only reason I gave them one star is that I couldn't award less.

I have been a Directv customer since 1995 when the receiver and dish cost about $800. Ever since then I have been a loyal Directv customer. NO MORE!!! I have had a few different DVRs (Digital Video Recorders) through the Directv service. They all have had TIVO software on them and have worked great. But suddenly, Directv had the bright idea to create their own DVRs with their own software. Hence the R15 was born. It has proven to be perhaps the biggest marketing disaster since New Coke. We already had a DVR in our living room and wanted one for our bedroom. They sent us the R15, for which I had to pay $100, plus recommit to a new 2-year deal. I didn't think this a problem, since I never had any difficulties with their equipment before and figured 2 more years with the service was a given. However, we found the new software to be very ""user unfriendly"". Even worse, it  had numerous glitches. Recording only 4 minutes of an hour-long episode, recording only half an episode, and some supposedly recorded programs would turn out to be just a blank screen when we tried to play it. In addition, the unit would constantly reset itself day after day for no apparent reason. Completely fed up, I called customer service who insisted that the unit is just fantastic and I just got a bad one. When I begged the guy to send me one with the original TIVO software on it, as beyond the technical problems, I simply found the new software to be horrible anyway and very difficult to use. He told me 'no problem'. However, what I received was yet another 'R15'. I called Directv once again, and they told me the fact that I did not receive what I requested was in fact, 'no surprise' as it was extremely difficult for them to get a hold of any unit besides the R15. They convinced me to give the R15 another try. So I did. You know where this is going. Not only did I once again experience problems, but it was a WHOLE NEW SET OF PROBLEMS. When I tried to play anything it supposedly recorded, all I got was a blank screen. Additionally, I could perform a menu function or change a channel once, but then the system would lock up for 5 minutes (not an exaggeration) before I could even change the channel again. A total nightmare. Fed up, I once again called Directv, asking for a refund of my $100 and to let me out of my 2-year contract. They unequivocally said 'no'. When I asked AGAIN for the 'R10' model to replace the horrible R15 model, they once again told me they would 'try'. Once again, another R15 showed up at my door. So basically friends, Directv swindled me into giving them two years of service in exchange for an inferior product that is essentially a total piece of junk. When my two year sentence is over, I am completely done with them forever. DO NOT GET SUCKERED INTO THIS!!! Just a friendly warning from someone who is tired of getting screwed by corporations that think they can get away with murder because they have a very recognizable name."

I also don't understand why you make people pay so much money up front for a receiver that they don't own.  Cable companies also lease their receivers, but at least they give them to the customer for free, including HDTV DVRs, whereas I had to pay a total of $600 for my HDTV and Plus DVRs and I don't even own them--that doesn't seem fair at all--in fact, it seems like a rip-off in comparison.  At the very least, I trust that (like with the cable companies) I am entitled to free repairs or replacements if my receivers should fail since they are only ""leased."" I am obviously stuck with this DVR if I don't want to eat a lot of money, but I hope you will take the following issues and use them to improve the quality of the DirecTV Plus DVRs with new hardware or a software update. 1. Unlike Tivo, the DirecTV Plus DVR is very unintelligent when it comes to knowing the difference between a first-run episode and a repeat.  This leads to dozens and dozens of unwanted programs being taped over and over again.  I shouldn't have to keep deleting episodes of shows that have already ended for the season and I shouldn't have to delete season passes to those shows just to get them to stop recording--that would negate the whole point of having a DVR.  This is a feature in drastic need of improvement. 2. Unlike Tivo, the DirecTV Plus DVR is not smart enough to refrain from recording first-run duplicates.  This is extremely annoying when you wind up with 5 recordings of the same episode of the Sopranos and other HBO shows, as well as shows from the UPN and WB that repeat themselves on weekends. 3. Unlike Tivo, the DirecTV Plus DVR does not allow you to switch live between the two tuners. 4. The menu system for the DirecTV Plus DVR is unintuitive and extremely slow, especially when trying to adjust the order of shows in the prioritizer or changing recording options. I sincerely hope that when the new MPEG4 HDTV DVR comes out in August that it will not be as disappointing as the DirecTV Plus DVR has been.  I have always thought that DirecTV had better customer service than Comcast, but in the case of DVRs, Comcast comes out on top and this may lead me to reconsider my options when my two year commitment is up."

After installing it, and using I have found quite a few flaws. One, the remote is awful, compared to the TIVO Remote, you have to keep looking at the buttons, way too many buttons to chose from. Secondly, escaping out of menu is not as easy to find. It doesn't record shows you might like, there are no ratings to rate programs. Controlling the speed to which you fast-forward is very fast but it is difficult to push the buttons to slow and stop, this needs to be improved. Another feature is watching two shows at once, you have to actually record a show then you can change a channel and go back, but it is not like the TIVO where you use the ""down arrow wheel"" and your back to the other program and can rewind. This is a SERIOUS flaw. One I have been a TIVO user for 5 years, and my wife and I decided last night to return the DVR for a HD-Tivo, even though it is more money, its worth it. This machine does have some nice things, but in all reality, its has many flaws which need to take place."

I hit the reset, reinserted the card and it still did not work. I unplugged the beast and left it unplugged for 15 seconds (hard reset) without any result. Directv replaced the unit and I have had a brand new one for about four weeks now. The new unit is now starting to turn itself off. This time, doing a hard restart worked but the unit is obviously verging on failure. Directv said they could do a hard drive replacement over the phone but I would lose everything I had recorded. That is like buying a new computer and having to constantly do a restore wiping out your hard drive. This product needs to be taken off the market."
528063,A1PA0UBM4SRGRY,0,1,48,B000ERD6HS,8/20/2006,1,4,5,Avoid unit at all costs,"My r10 (the Tivo based DirecTv DVR) crapped out last week. I bought the r15 as a replacement. I knew I was giving up Tivo, but I figured it couldn't be as bad as everyone was saying it was. I figured all the negative press about the R15 was from Tivo worshipers who would poo-poo any non Tivo device no matter what it was like. After a couple of weeks of agony with the r15, allow me to say it officially sucks. The r15 should be should be studied in user interface design classes as an example of what not to do. I'm utterly in shock, because I'm forced to accept the fact the designers of the UI for the r15 are members of the same species as the designers of Tivo. The r15 has caused me to loose faith in the intelligence of the human race. I've only been using the unit for a week or so, and here are the highlights: 1) The manual doesn't match the user interface in my unit. So, fell free to chuck it out the window, it won't help you. 2) The R15 has something like season passes, but it took me hours to figure it out, not nearly as easy as it was with Tivo. It also has the ability to prioritize your season passes, but it was quite difficult to find that bit of functionality as well. 3) The r15 does have a 30-second 'skip' feature built in. However in the r15, you are forced to still watch commercials, because the 'skip' is really an intelligent fast forward that zooms you through 30 seconds of video in about 3 to 4 seconds. Not a big deal, but the 30 second skip on Tivo was way better. 4) There is no way to tell what each tuner is recording. So, if you are recording two programs and you change the channel, I still haven't been able to figure out what happens. The unit offers to stop recording a show to allow you to watch live TV, but I can't figure out how it chooses which show to stop recording. Several times I've had to go manually stop a recording in order to watch live TV, in order to make sure it stopped recording the show I wanted. How stinking hard is it to ask the user what to do? 5) The navigation started out ok, but now it is horrible. Simple actions such as fast forward and rewind respond intermittently. It's like the receiver is schizophrenic, it just ignores you. At times it's almost unusable, and the instant replay functionality is so poor I actually find myself not using it. 6) The unit will miss recordings at random. Important recordings with the highest priority levels. Bottom line: Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. This unit totaly SUCKS. If I had the time and money, I would seriously consider alternatives, but I'm stuck. The r15 is still better than a VCR or DVD recorder but it's a very far cry from the Tivo. This unit was obviously shipped out without proper testing. I bet DirecTV just shipped it figuring they could fix the problems later. Update After nearly 6 months of use of this product, things have not gotten better. Here are the new highlights: 1) Several times the unit has decided to stop recording a large number of my shows. I have to delete and cancel them in order for the unit to pick them back up. 2) The unit crashes once every couple of weeks. The unit crashed during the first quarter of the superbowl, and we missed most of the 1st quarter. 3) The response time to remote control button presses is horrible. Sometimes you'll wait 5+ seconds to see your show list come up after you press the button. And you know the unit receives the command, because a light on the front panel blinks every time you press a button on the remote. Fast forwarding and rewinding are painful, you over/undershoot your target because the unit response time is so poor. 4) Unit will delete a pre-recorded show while you are watching them. 5) R15 often gets confused if you watch programs that are still taping. Sometimes if you select a program to watch that is still taping, it will start you off watching the program live. Very annoying for sporting events, I can't count the number of times I've started a football game 30 minutes late, only to have it ruined by the fact the R15 started playing the game live. ARGH! Once you see the score, why bother? I hear Comcast and Tivo are going to become partners later this year. I can't wait, once they do I'm dumping my dish and I'm not going to look back."

One would think I have a defective unit, I sent this unit back to DIRECTV and they replaced it for another.  Does the same thing!!  I guess when the hard drive gets past 50% this is what happens. The unit doesn't record when you go back and forth on 2 channels like the TIVO did.  When you record series you can not record the same program on 2 channels.

Directv Plus is a minus!,"If you are considering this machine as a new Directv customer, I would say go for it.  Directv is a great service and this high capacity receiver/DVR seems to fit the bill for a reasonable price.  I, however, have been using a Directv with Tivo receiver for 3 years and am finding that the features and the remote control are too different for me to easily adjust to without getting frustrated and disappointed.  Read on for more details..... --------------------- I bought this to replace a March 2003 vintage 35 hour Directv/TiVo receiver and am returning it as soon as possible.  I purchased the R15 for its:  100 hour recording capacity; the 90-minute ""buffer"" for live tv; 2 satellite line input (record one show, watch another).  I was intrigued by the R15's more traditional-shaped remote than the Tivo peanut-shaped remotes. After two nights, I am seriously disappointed, for the following reasons: - If you are used to TiVo, the Directv Plus menus and functionality are far less user friendly and the remote buttons are very hard to decipher.  The R15 remote makes you appreciate the elegant simplicity of the Tivo remote.  The R15's fast forward and rewind buttons are not very responsive, meaning that you have to play around with them a few times to get to a precise place in a recording. (Maybe this would get easier for each user over time.)  In contrast, a Tivo remote seems to ""know"" where you want to go. - This machine does allow you to watch one show while recording another.  Unfortunately if you have used an old Directv/Tivo receiver this won't be enough to satisfy you.  The old Directv with Tivo receivers' two satellite inputs are BOTH available for recording. It is easy to switch between satellite inputs if you have two shows recording buffering at once.  You can be recording two satellite feeds and watching a previously recorded program all at the same time.   The ability to record a baseball game and your favorite network show on the same DVR while simultaneously watching a previously recorded program is truly an amazing feature that our family can't give up after 3 years.  For those of you are interested go to WeeKnees.com and look at their Directv DVRs page to learn more. - The Directv Plus's ""Active"" guide or channel is cluttered and seems to be just a big sales pitch for Directv pay per view or sports package programming.  The one neat thing is the ability to get your home zip-code weather on your tv screen.  I don't really care to check my horoscope on the satellite each day, however. The Directv Plus menus and guide seems similar to digital cable services I have seen.  If so, this machine will make it easier for someone who is used to using a digital cable box to make the change to Directv.  For a long time Directv and Tivo user, I feel I have to make too big of a re-training leap. I'm returning this R15 receiver and buying one of the few remaining Directv with Tivo receivers that are left out there."

NEVER have I seen a more worthless combination of hardware/software. Direct TV's solution to all problems is to reformat the hard drive. Microsoft operating systems are bad, but at least all you have to do is reboot. Imagine if after every 75 hours of using your PC you had to reformat the hard drive! Would you consider that acceptable? The core problem is the operating system for the R15 does NOT have a disk defragment utility. As the hard drive becomes increasingly fragmented performance and reliability degrade. The only recourse is to reformat the hard drive, which of course erases everything on the disk. So you lose all setup/configuration settings and recorded programs..."

In four years, our TiVo had never had a problem. This unit crashed twice in the first 24 hours and two dozen times in the 2 weeks thereafter. DirecTV replaced the unit, twice, and we continued to experience problems. The software was obviously not anywhere near ready for the market and lacked features our TiVo could do for years. We had to call customer service 22 times during this hellish ordeal. I demanded a TiVo version be sent to me and they admitted that despite the flood of problems this unit has caused, they no longer offer the old version. I ended up buying the R10 model off of eBay and DirecTV paid for it because they could not give me a unit that worked on the most basic of levels. DirecTV should have never released this product in the state it was and certainly should never have asked anyone to pay for it. The opinions posted online are overwhelmingly negative and I even came across two people that were physically reduced to tears due to this box.

I'm not sure what the impulse was behind the couple of favorable reviews here. I can only imagine that if this was someone's first experience with a DVR, they might be more forgiving and assume that all the problems in this unit are inherent in DVRs in general. THEY ARE NOT!

(A workaround with about a 70% chance of success is to ""stop & keep"" the recording before the feed cuts out, then go to the list, select the game, and tell it to keep it again. You are out of luck until the end of the six hour game time slot if you want to watch TV after the game is over and the feed has already cut out -- anything you do will cause it to delete the recording.)

The R10 made DirecTV a clear winner; the R15 has me thinking that cable or Dish Network might be a better choice. The user interface is OK, but is clumsy and clunky in comparison to TiVo.  It has a few features that are pretty good, but instead of having their software people work on cool features, they should have had them working on making the R15 stable and reliable instead.  At least a couple of times each month, I see it freeze, stop responding to the remote, lock up or restart itself.  That's not a complete list; unfortunately there are too many malfunctions and performance problems for me to remember and itemize here. R15 problems are widespread:  If you look at the tech support forums at DirecTV, a lot of different people in a lot of different places have had a lot of different complaints.  It looks like a bug report database for software that's not ready to go to production  ---yet they continue to push them out and hope that stacking ""software update"" band-aids on it will fix the deep flaws in the system software (NDS has an unimpressive history and apparent lack of software dev talent). If you get an R15, be prepared to 1) keep the details and paper together for the 30-day return policy, 2) be disappointed with the ""downgrade"" from TiVo, 3) use a power socket that's easy to reach (you'll have to unplug it and plug it back in fairly often since it frequently locks up / freezes), and 4) adjust your expectation with the R15's ""normal"" operation to give you picture glitches, change channels by itself, lose one of the two tuners (comes back after you unplug / reboot), or any of another dozen malfunctions.

The program guide works well, you can search for programs by title and actors.  While doing just about anything, it puts a PIP display in the upper right corner of the screen.  We have ours programmed to 'record series' for about 20 shows, you can tell the DVR to keep 1,2,3,5,all shows in a series.  Live TV pause works great, you can hit exit to return to live TV.  The 30-second skip feature works pretty well, as does the 'skip back' button if you've gone too far ahead. I especially liked the subtitling feature implemented by direcTV when you hit the mute button.  There is no need to activate real subtitles (stupidly, there are 8 subtitling standards to choose from, but direcTV has done away with that stupidity !!!) As someone who has only used high-end VCRs in the past, this unit is great and we couldn't be happier.  I don't understand the gripes of the Tivo users, it seems that many of them are unwilling to learn a new user interface, i.e. laziness has factored into their review opinions.

Unfortunately, I didn't read any in this case, but I wish I had.  This product is awful.  And to those who claim everyone else must be incompetent because they haven't read the manual, I'd like for you to let me know in the manual where it says how to prevent these kinds of problems: 1) When I manually set something to record one time through the guide, I expect the machine to record it, not to record 10 minutes of black screen and nothing else. 2) When I play back something that actually managed to record, playback freezes and skips, and then quits back to the regular live programming.  I have to start the playback over from the beginning.  It regularly takes us about an hour and fifteen minutes to get through a one-hour recorded program, even considering fast fowarding through commercials.  We're usually extremely frustrated and annoyed by the time we're done watching playback, that is when we aren't frustrated to the point that we just quit in the middle of the show.  It's not a satellite issue, because the same programs, when watched live, play just fine. 3) Service for this product is just as bad.  Normally, I love DirecTV service.  They're usually very friendly and helpful.  But they recommend re-formatting the hard drive to resolve the issue.  This is just not an acceptable resolution, because it will delete all of the shows I have recorded.  I regularly keep a decent inventory of shows to watch and there is no way to watch them all before my next show records.  So if I constantly have shows recording, it will take me weeks of extra tv watching to get through the shows I currently have plus all of the new shows that record.  So, what I've decided to do is use this POS to watch (and suffer through) what I can't watch on the internet, then delete everything else, and watch those deleted shows on the internet until I get the old R10 Tivo model on eBay. 4) I have to admit, the remote control is pretty poorly designed.  It doesn't bug me so much now, since I've had it for a few years and become accustomed to it.  But it is pretty poorly designed. Anyhow, no axe to grind with DirecTV, other than this box is terrible.  Normally the rest of their service is great."

I never had any issues at all with the R15 not functioning as it should.  My biggest pet peeve is the screen saver that comes on ALL THE TIME and you have to find the remote and hit a button to make it go away.  I'll be in the middle of watching something and up pops the screen saver and I have to scramble to find my remote.  Very annoying.  I live alone and like to leave my TV on when I'm at work (I work nights) so that it looks like someone is home,  but thanks to the screen saver, it might as well be turned off.  DirecTV says there's no way of turning it off. I'm switching to Verizon Fios and back to my beloved TiVO, to which the R15 does not compare."

We originally signed up with a TiVo box and loved the service.  Customer support was terrific! Then, though, after several years, when the TiVo box gave out, we contacted Direct TV, who replaced the TiVo unit with this one.  In only a few months, we went from being delighted customers of Direct TV to being pretty darned unhappy for only this reason.  Among other problems, the R15: 1) freezes periodically, causing a hard restart (unplugging the box and replugging it); 2) is very very very very slow to respond to almost every single input via the remote.  This happens even after we replace batteries and even if we're standing right in front of it--and even though absolutely we programmed the remote properly.  Then: 3) once it does respond, if we've gotten impatient and pushed the button(s) several times, it'll flip through everything at once; 4) often doesn't record when it's been programmed to; 5) has a horrible white UI that lights up the room if we want to check the guide.  This isn't so good if we want to change channels while a spouse is sleeping (if, say, we use the box in our bedroom). 6) isn't nearly as intuitive as the Tivo machine was in terms of scheduling programs to record.  Since this may be more of a personal preference I'll won't dwell on this one. But the first 4 were so bad that they frustrated us to the point where we considered going back to cable.  [Edited so as not to bash Direct TV: though it told us that this was the only model available, the company did resolve our complaints satisfactorily--as always.] At any rate, I don't mean to sound like a commercial for TiVo or cable, but, if you ask me, this machine is the only reason I can come up with NOT to be a customer of Direct TV.  That's how bad it is. I would give it 0 stars if I could. And I still have to say: shame on Direct TV for foisting on its customers this horrible piece of equipment.  It's the one black mark from an otherwise exemplary company."

If you use to have the TiVo DVR I would stick with that, even if it means buying a used Direct TV TiVo DVR. My R15 broke the other day and I am sending it back.  (Note that I orginally had to pay $100 at Best Buy for this piece of junk and then the monthly lease fee because you don't actually own it). The Direct TV people promised to send me a replacement DVR.  I told them only to send me one if it was a TiVo DVR.  They swore it would be.  But when I opened the box is was another R15.  Now I have fight with them to send this back and have the charges for it removed from my account. I will continue to use Direct TV but have swore off ever using the hardware that they provide.  I will buy and use my own Direct TV TiVo that I have purchased used. The reoccurring problem with Direct TV seems to be in activating the equipment that they provide. Also, when I got the last R15 that just broke it was to replace another receiver of theirs that had broke.

All that changed when Direct TV replaced the old DVRs with the R15. This machine has more mechanical and software issues then any 100 persons could list. It freezes, records only part of shows, blacks out and that is just 5 percent of the problems. If you love Direct TV and want it to survive,  demand the R15s are scrapped and replaced with fully functional DVRs.

But apparently, I was fortunate, in that DirecTV released a major new software version around the end of January 2007, just before I installed mine.  So, in doing some reading, I've apparently avoided the worst of the stability problems.  So far, the unit has been functional and stable, at least (knock wood.)  By the way, I have the R15/500. The user interface is functional and fairly simple - perhaps too simple.  I find the DirecTV guide to be a bit clunky and laborious in general, and so the R15 inherits that.   But basic functions are fairly obvious and easy-to-use, if not exactly ""intuitive."" The Series-Link function works, mostly, but it seems to be easily confused by programs that appear multiple times, on multiple channels.  That is, it's not always able to determine whether a series installment is ""First Run"" (one of the recording choices.)   So, it tends to make multiple recordings of the same episodes at times, which isn't really that bad a thing. I'd have to say, so far, this is a reasonable unit - stable, quiet, and functional, at a very decent price.  The basic functions all work fine,  and the 90-minute record buffer is nice.  The one thing that disappoints me so far is that there's no built-in networking enabled.  I'd like to be able to view recorded programs on other devices on my home network, and be able to transfer recorded programs to other devices. It'd be interesting to hear from any previous reviewers as to whether the software updates have resolved the worst of their complaints."
528036,AD3PVF4GNKD4I,0,1,21,B000ERD6HS,8/1/2006,4,5,8,A pleasant surprise,"I recently received an R15 to replace my DirecTV Tivo (HDVR2) whose hard drive dies a horrible death. After reading the reviews here, it was with more than a little trepidation that I faced the new receiver. I ever installed a spare hard drive in the Tivo box to bring it back to life, figuring I could return the R15 if I didn't like it. I'm keeping the R15. The Tivo did have some advantages. I liked its season pass better than the R15 series link - it was a bit better at not picking up duplicates. The Tivo's dual buffers was nice, but to be honest, I find the single longer 90 minute buffer much more useful - I often found myself running out of buffer time when something (like a long phone call) interrupted a show. The Tivo had a slightly more responsive user interface, with some tasks taking fewer key presses. On the other hand, the R15 has significant advantages: It's dead silent. My Tivo box in particular was very loud (and I'd heard complaints from others on this score). The guide is MUCH faster for scrolling - and I love the +-12 hour horizontal scroll. The ability to set up all sorts of searches and record everything that matches the search is very nice - and can overcome limitations in the Series Link. The folders and grouping on the recorded shows list makes organizing recordings simple. The screen saver is great (no more worrying about long pauses on a plasma screen). Unlike the Tivo, where the show you were watching vanished while performing many programming tasks, with the R15 your current show appears in a small window while you're doing pretty much everything (guide, setting up new recordings, etc.). Very nice. The R15 remote also did a better job handling my TV (even supporting change of the display format - something I previously had to switch remotes to do). There were a few other features that impressed me that I don't recall offhand. Of course, I may have been lucky - I've had no mysterious crashes or reboots. But in terms of functionality, while the menu system did take some getting used to, overall I've been very pleasantly surprised by this unit."
528035,A1FJQBHG7BWFHQ,0,1,20,B000ERD6HS,3/12/2007,1,3,5,R15 is horrible.  What were they thinking?,"If I had to guess, DirecTV management is well aware of their mistake with regard to their current DVR equipment provider.  The equipment they use now, the R15, is simply horrible.  I've been a customer of theirs for 3-4 years now, and was extremely happy with my original DVR (Phillips DSR704).  Unfortunately, that hard drive died last fall, and I was forced to go with what DirecTV uses now-- the aforementioned R15.  I am not exaggerating when I say that unless DirecTV finds a replacement (a complete replacement, not an upgrade) for this flawed device, I will be going to Dish Network when my contract is done.  It's quite sad, actually, because I've been very happy with DirecTV up until this point.  But there's very little to like about the R15, and enough is enough.  This is a common theme among friends and internet sites, and I have to wonder how DirecTV's bottom line is being affected.  It simply has to be by now. I have 2 of these R15s (I believe they're both R15 400's), and they both are quirky, unreliable and completely user unfriendly.  Initially I thought it was because I was so used to the Tivo-based DSR704, which was easy, reliable (until it died, at least) and just made sense.  I love new gadgets, I liked the 100hrs of recording time, etc, so surely I would get used to the R15.  Nope.  It remains a mess. I experience the same problems the rest of you seem to have: fast forward skips (seemingly only during commercials), shows don't record, time slider freezes, unit freezes, pathetically slow, poor record quality--  and these are ONLY the technical issues!  This does not even factor in the complete and total misengineering of user functions. I mean honestly-- what were they THINKING?  While obviously not to the level of publicity as the failed 'New Coke' campaign of the 80's, I would have to think that when all is said and done, DirecTV's decision to go with the R15 and whomever designed it will haunt them for years. I'm sure they're banking on two things:  It's cheaper, and they will assume the majority of subscribers won't know any better.  But the rest of us know a flawed product when they see it, and will eventually make the decision to leave. DirecTV has about 6 months left before my contract is done.  They'd better get busy."

The record function works occasionally.  When I do manage to record a program, sometimes I am greeted with a black screen when I try to view the program.  The unit is very slow to respond and this can sometimes cause to user to do something unintended.  There are 2 usb ports on the unit that are there for decoration it would appear as they have no functionality at this time.  If this was simply a receiver it would work ok, but as a DVR it leaves much to be desired.

Adding to my angst is the manufacturer's failure to acknowledge the severity and scope of problems and the lack of commitment to timely resolving them. Telephone support is laughable, since the techs don't generally realize that the problems are endemic to the unit. Resetting, reformatting, or replacing the unit will not resolve problems of the sort I experience. I cannot fathom why a handful of users have not had similar problems.

It must have just been $$$ signs because their decision to drop TIVO and go with their own severely flawed unit simply smacks of corporate suicide.  About a year ago my first Hughes TIVO died due to a hard disk crash. DirecTV, to their credit, replaced it with an R10 model for free.  That has been wonderful as it still used the TIVO operating system.  But just last week, the Hughes TIVO in the bedroom crashed and DirecTV once again sent out a replacement.  But this time it was an R15.  I only had to take one look at the totally brain-dead remote to realize this was going to be a nightmare.  And sure enough, just as soon as I had it connected up and turned on, it rebooted 3 times all by itself, right in the middle of configuring the satelite and remote. What people are saying is absolutely true.  This is a piece of garbage compared to our old TIVO units.  In summary: 1. The remote's key placement and design is 100% retarded.  It nearly takes two hands to use it. 2. The response to button presses is delayed and sluggish. 3. The failure to allow managing 2 tuners and their buffers is a major oversight and setback from the TIVO units. 4. The user interface is completely awkward and unintuitive.  Even as an engineer, I had to thoroughly read the manual just to figure out how to record a program.  If your mother can't figure out how to make her VCR record, she is NEVER, EVER going to figure out this beast. 5. It is not possible to turn off our TV without having to slide the remote's selector switch all the way over to ""TV"", even though I have programmed the remote for our TV's codes and it works OK to MUTE and change the volume. 6. The fonts on the display are so small and narrow that it is very hard to read on our small (19"") bedroom TV. TIVO had nice big screens but these DirecTV guys must assume every TV you own is a giant 50"" plasma model because that's the only way you are going to read the screen without squinting. I could go on and on.  I'm so dissapointed with this piece of junk and the fact that DirecTV has caused me to even waste my time on this negative review but I feel very strongly that the world needs to know that DirecTV has REALLY made a SERIOUS error in judgement this time.  I have been with DirecTV for over 12 years since I bought my first $600 receiver from RadioShack in 1995.

If like me you can't live without Tivo then you have to scour ebay for used Directv tivos. Why Directv broke up with Tivo I will never understand. When I wanted to add another DVR to my existing Tivo I let myself be talked into a R15 by a tech who had both and told me the r15 was better. I had it for 2 days and hated it. The most important button for me is the pause button. On Tivo its the 2nd biggest button on the remote, is dead center, and is the only yellow one as well. On the R15 its a tiny button to the left of middle. I returned it and asked for a refurbished Tivo. Two days later a new r15 arrived FedEx. I asked again for a refurb tivo and two days later another r15 came. This happened 4 times before they admitted to me that they can request a Refurb tivo but if the warehouse doesn't have one they send the r15. I went on ebay and bought a used tivo. I have no idea why Directv tried to reinvent the wheel but I hear the new heads of Directv are looking to rekindle their relationship. One could only hope. I now have 4 receivers in the house. My kids both have the r15 for the last year without any problems. Bottom line if you never had a Tivo you will probably like the r15. If you have used Tivo you probably will be using ebay."

Never had a problem with the dvr. Functions fabulously and would recommend anyone upgrading to it. For all the people who hate, did you ever try the red reset button before you wrote those or called DTV complaining.

528019,AMQ1MEG334SAP,0,1,4,B000ERD6HS,11/25/2007,1,3,7,A Lot of Hot Air!,"We recently got DirecTV after seeing their ad blitz for 75 HD channels. They brag about their ""digital picture and sound,"" and their great customer service. The truth is the only way to get digital picture and sound is with a HDTV and an HDMI. Their picture is actually worse than the picture we got with Comcast. Not to mention there is no two year agreement with cable, no picture loss when it rains, you do not have to pay for ""leased equipment, and you do not need an ugly dish hanging on your house. When we purchased our most recent HDTV, we figured we would replace the DVR we had with DirecTV and get an HD DVR to replace it. DirecTV told us we would have to pay $299 for the privlige of leasing their receiver from them. In addition to this we would have to pay $50 because we were a new customer ""and had not established a credit history with them."" Also, we would have to pay $20 for shipping and handling and extend our contract for another two years. Maybe DirecTV thinks it is in the cellphone business because all they want to do is lock you into long-term contracts and make you bleed money to them forever. Their symbol should be a ball and chain because that is what they really are. Cable here I come!"
528018,A2A25LT554YGEU,0,0,3,B000ERD6HS,7/7/2006,4,3,9,I actually like this DVR,"I'm going to buck the trend here, and give this DVR a fairly high ranking.  I got one a couple weeks ago, and so far I haven't had any problems with it.  I don't have any issues that other reviewers have mentioned (freezing, constant rebooting, recording a blank screen).  If I do start experiencing those types of problems then you can bet I would change my tune.  All that being said, there are some pros and cons when comparing this DVR to the R10 (with TiVo).  First, some quick background.  I first got DirecTV about 4 years ago, with a couple standard (non-DVR) receivers.  About a year or so later, we upgraded our living room receiver to the DVR with TiVo.  Then a couple weeks ago, that unit died, and I went out and got the R15. When comparing the R10 to the R15, you need to keep one thing in mind - there are two main sets of features that you need to compare.  The first set is the DVR-specific functionality (recording, setting up season passes, finding shows, playing back a show that's been recorded, etc.).  In this respect, the tivo wins hands-down.  The interface is very intuititive, and very cohesive, and very easy to use, as well as very consistent. The second set of features are what I term the DirecTV-specific functionality.  In other words, even though this unit is a DVR, it's also a DirecTV receiver, which has it's own set of functions.  For this set, the new R15 wins hands-down.  The tivo DVR had 2 real bare-bones type of receivers included.  All of the nice functionality that I had with my initial receiver (non-DVR) was gone.  For example, the guide was miserably slow when scrolling, there were no channel filters, there's only one set of customized channels, when you hit the guide button, the guide shows up on top of the show you're watching... that kind of stuff.  Very stripped down versions of the receivers. The new R15 has an ok DVR interface (it's clunky, and you're required to do too many button-presses to get stuff done).  It's not as nice as the tivo unit.  However, much of the DirecTV functionality that I missed with the tivo unit is very much included with the new R15.  Also, the DVR and DirecTV functionality are much better integrated with the R15.  For example, with the R10 (tivo) you switch between live tv and tivo central - which drove me nuts.  I couldn't understand why you couldn't just access the menus while watching TV.  With the R15, you can do that.  The separation between the DVR side and the receiver side is much more seemless.  Some might say that it's too well integrated - you can't use the R15 as a stand-alone unit.  With the tivo unit, you could still do things like pause live TV and record manually without signing up for the tivo service.  With the R15, the DVR functionality is very much tied into the service (I couldn't pause a live show until I had that service activated by DirecTV, e.g.). There is one feature that I do miss, however, since upgrading to the R15.  Tivo gives you two live tuners.  Each tuner has its own 30-minute buffer, and you can flip between the two tuners with the press of one button.  That allows you to watch two shows at the same time.  Watch show 1 until it hits a commercial, flip to the other tuner.  Rewind show 2 to get back to where you left off, and watch show 2 until the commercial and then flip back to tuner 1. The R15 doesn't have that feature.  There's a 90-minute buffer, but it's a shared buffer.  There is no flipping between tuners.  However, you can get around this by recording both shows and just flipping between them on the guide (you can watch the shows you're recording, and when you switch on the guide, you now have two buffers). This runs counter to what another reviewer mentioned.  They mentioned that you can't record two separate shows at the same time while watching a third that's already recorded.  This is not correct.  You can most definitely do that (after reading that review, I did exactly that to prove to myself that it could be done). Overall, this is not a bad unit.  I wish the DVR functionality were less clunky, and I would love to have to two live tuners back, but aside from that I do like the new DVR.  It also has some nice features that the tivo unit doesn't: - screen saver -- why the tivo unit DOESN'T have one is beyond me, - filters - additional favorite channels list - you can also move along the guide in 12-hour increments, and the guide is so much nicer in this unit - I also think that the picture quality on this unit is nicer than it was on the tivo unit."

But I have to say that I was pretty miffed by the last Tivo upgrade in July of 2006. Wow, no more Tivo after a simple upgrade from Tivo. I called Tivo, and their solution was to buy a new one. I said ""Huh??, it was working fine before the upgrade."". So I thought I would give DirecTV Plus a try as my Tivo had been broken by Tivo's upgrade and I needed to ""buy another one"". (Or switch back to an earlier version of the software through taking my Tivo apart and putting the hard disk in my desktop PC.) I was also tired of Tivo that was not integrated with a satellite system and could run the latest software which the R10 can not. (This might be a good thing in the long run.) Dish Networks looked to be in a legal battle with Tivo so I said DirecTV Plus is a good place to start with another flavor of the DVR/PVR. The results, my seven year old can use it with no issues. I like it and it just works. It's interface is not as clean in some areas, but in others it is better. I wish the remote was a bit more sensitive to a user response during fast forwards. But on the whole, it is a winner. I would highly recommend this DVR if you are looking for a solid and integrated solution for Satellite TV viewing. Tivo is a midst of changes right now. They are losing and gaining market share right now. They have a new release which includes ""Kids Zone"" which is really cool, but very buggy. Tivo can be hacked and the disk space is fairly easy to extend, but software updates will break this hack sometimes. But, if you are like me and just want to watch a show or two. This DVR is great and easy to use. It has a few short comings, but it looks to be a very dependable unit for now. Tivo is for the true geek or nerd. And if you have cable or don't mind more equipment on top of your TV. I love it and still have a couple for my kids. But the DirecTV Plus, is on our main TV. It works and is easy to use. I suspect with time it will become even better. Bottom line, if you like to watch TV and just want a dependable unit to record the shows you like, DirecTV Plus is a great option. If you like to do more than watch TV and would like to play with show filters, connect to your local area network, connect to Yahoo!, or other things not related to just recording you show, Tivo is for you.  Just be mindful that you will need to still have a Satalite receiver or two to record two shows at the same time. The R10 model is no longer made and is running dependable software but is not planed to be upgraded. But it is a great option and will record two shows at the same time."

While I'm quite happy with much of the 8860DN, there are a few things that could use improvement.  Some of these can be addressed in software, others I fear are hardware issues. BTW, I'm on my second machine because I thought some of the issues with the first warranted a replacement.  Now I know its a ""common"" issue. 1)  The print engine creaks and makes popping sounds as the fuser heats and cools.  Even the demo machine in Office Depot does the same thing.  The creaking is really annoying if you sit near the machine.  A Brother senior tech rep tells me this issue is common to many Brother lasers.  Well, gimme a break because HP and others don't creak!  **UPDATE**  Brother Corporate office tells me the popping sounds are considered ""normal"" by the engineers and at this time they have no plans to fix.  Pathetic if you ask me.  I think most users will agree!!! 2)  The scanner ADF head will sometimes make odd sounds when its scanning the last page of a multi-page scan.  It sounds as if the motor or gears need lubrication. 3)  I've had the COPY function lockup on me a couple times (other fucntions continue to work) and the only way to correct is to power cycle.  Cause is unknown but the clowns at Brother support tell me to keep power cycling the resolve the problem.  IDIOTS! 4)  The IFAX feature is not very well explained and is somewhat odd in the way it works (or tries to work).  I've yet to really figure it out.  As an alternative I use the FAX FORWARD TO EMAIL function which works well. 5)  A PC software bug:  When scanning multiple pages its impossible to multitask since the scanner interface takes the focus away from whatever you are doing everytime it begins scanning a new page.  Brother apparently knows about this issue and will correct in the next software version. Other than the above isues, I'm fairly satisfied in the short time I've been using this MFC.  If I may comment in response to one of the previous reviews, the beep sound is adjustable and I believe if the user took the time to read the manual, he'd be quite happy with the level of customization available on this machine (I rarely hear of people complaining about too many features).  Oh, and yes as stoneaged as it sounds, some people still do occasionally receive faxes. As far as I'm concerned, the print speed is excellent.  Even complex pages print quickly with nearly no delay between pages.  A huge improvment over my old HP.  Also, I find the scan speed on non complex scans to be excellent.  Complex and high res scans are somewhat slower, but they are with many scanners (and certainly about every multifucntion I've run across).  Print duplexing is another very nice touch and I'm surprised it works as well as it does.  The 8860DN gets the job done and it does them well overall. Things about the 8860DN I prefer over the new HP 3390 I compared it to. 1) 8860 has a legal size scan plate 2) 8860 will fax forward to email 3) 8860 is $150 less with approx. the same cost per page in consumables. 4)  8860 does duplex scan, copy"

HOWEVER, the printer uses 1024 WATTS or 9.1 Amps when it powers up to print a page or make a copy.  This has caused me alot of problems. I installed the printer at home in my study.  I have two desktop computers, modem, router, HP P1100 color printer,Canon PC 720 Copier, desk lamps, etc.  The electrical circuit for the study is a 15 AMP circuit.  Everytime the printer powers up, I take a ""power hit"".  Fortunately, I have a UPS for each computer and the UPS units kick in to keep the systems from completely shutting down. I'm going to have to install a new electrical outlet and run the wire to another circuit in order to keep the printer. Before you buy, you may want to add up the WATTS of all of the equipment you have on that circuit.  A 15 Amp circuit has max of 1800 WATTS; A 20 Amp circuit has max of 2400 WATTS.  The 8860DN will use 1024 of the WATTS on that circuit.

This printer does not have a straight-through output path for envelopes.  Instead, they have to make a sharp turn inside the machine, which severely creases them, to the point of interfering with the printing. Take a look at the diagram of envelopes they don't support on page 15 of the manual, and you'll see a picture of every conceivable type of envelope.  Bottom line: they don't support any, but aren't willing to admit it. I would be embarassed to send my letters out in envelopes looking like this.  I returned the unit and got an HP 3390, which does envelopes perfectly.  It's otherwise pretty much the same, but $250 more."

There have only been a couple of issues that I've come across.  The feature set is excellent.  I use the scan to FTP function to automatically send scanned documents to my web server- making them instantly available online.  The duplex is the biggest reason I bought it- and the scanner duplex and printing/faxing/copy duplex are flawless.  Items that I've come across- the machine can poll a Pop account and automatically print any text emails, or TIF attachments (according to the manual).  I use j2 fax, and it sends my faxes to an email as a TIF.  This was perfect in theory, but the machine refuses to print the j2 attachments (""unsupported file type"").  Second, the scan to FTP sometimes gives an ""ERROR""- no explanation and no mention in the manual- I was on hold with tech support and finally gave up.  A power cycle of the printer clears the problem.  Third, the light on the printer LCD intermittently flips on for no reason and the printer is next to my desk.  Unfortunately for my ADD, any flashy light gets my attention immediately and this has been annoying me lately.   Lastly, the manual feed (or thick paper tray) is only accessible by pulling the front panel down and thus extends the already large footprint, plus exposing some of the inside to dust, etc.  So you can't keep it open unless you are actually feeding in paper- which makes using envelopes a little more of a pain.  I was hoping to just throw a few envelopes in there and print as necessary but that is not possible.  Overall this is a very good piece of hardware with a solid ADF and feature set.  Fast printing and excellent resolution on scans and printing.  I highly recommend- just be prepared for a bug or two."

I found it much easier to scan from my PC than to use the front panel interface, as many of the settings could be preset from the software instead of being set on the unit's front panel.

I Checked all the reviews for months, every multifunction gets reamed by the reviewers, but not this one. I wanted automatic feeder capability on the scanner plus high quality printing and an easy way to print lables/envelopes. This unit does it all and does it well. I scanned in over 2000 sheets of paper in 2 days and had only 4 jams. 3 because I was scanning quite a bit of really flimsy paper and 1 because I forgot to remove a paper clip. Most of the time, I just hit scan and went to do some other work while the machine handled business. My office is now paperless. A nice feature of the scanner is the interface on your computer allows you to program several buttons for where you would like to save your scan and how you want to save a document (ie one button was programed to save to my work as a legal sized jpg. another button was programmed to save to my pictures as a pdf). This means all you need to do is put your papers in the feeder, click the proper button, name the file you're scanning then hit scan. Couldn't be any easier. One issue that others mention that is annoying is that when you are scanning, the status comes up on your computer when each new page begins to go through, this means you have to click back onto whatever you're working on (or hit alt + tab) then it'll happen again when the next page begins to scan. However, I am happy that while scanning above through the document feeder, I am still able to print down below. As far as the sounds others mention, GIVE ME A BREAK! This machine is quiet compared to every other printer I've used at home or in the office. As long as you have moving parts, there will be some sounds. But this printer only takes seconds to warm up and then its done. One feature you will love is the manual tray in the front. If you do any type of work where you need to print labels, envelopes, or other odd shaped items, this tray is great. The fax works well and doesn't miss pages like my old HP did constantly. No more babysitting an outgoing fax, just hit send and rest assured that everything will go through. Overall, I am actually astonished at how well this multifunction works for the price. This is the first multifunction I've used (and I've used many) where all the functions work very well. I am giving this 5 stars because that represents the value of this machine."

Canon ranked better overall but it doesn't work with Macintoshes so I was afraid at first I might be disappointed. However, I have been happy with this from day one. It was SO easy to set up, and it is has been very easy to figure out how to get it to do different functions. It interfaces seamlessly with my MacBook Pro and the wireless works perfectly. The pages do curl but that seems relatively minor because they straighten right out. The print is sharp (if a little lighter than I would like). Unlike other machines I checked out, the plastic parts on this machine feels sturdy, yet the overall weight of it is manageable. I've had it a little over two months and have, among other things, printed out a 200 page manuscript; it has given me no trouble. The duplex has several options and is easy to use. I have liked the layout on the function buttons and have found them to be readable and intuitive. In the research stage, I plagued Customer Service multiple times with questions but they were always nice, patient, and helpful. I especially liked it that their customer service is still free even after the warranty is over. I have not tried the scanner, but everything else suits me fine."

But then I found out that by connecting the MFC to Airport with a firewire I could have both computers and MFC set up as a network. If you go through the set up in the beginning and can't find the IP address for the printer, you can check it on the LCD by pressing Menu 612.

Other than the foregoing DESIGN FLAW, its a good machine but for me, this is a FATAL FLAW so I took it back to Office Depot. It was interesting to get the reaction of a couple of techs at Brother as they too couldn't believe the engineers forgot this critical function! I will just have to be satisfied with my MFC-8440 until they come out with a new 30 page per minute duplexing machine with the old by-pass capability."

Went around looking at inkjet multifunction, laser multifunction and different vendors. In the end, the price point, network connectivity and duplex printing of 8860dn won out over the other multifunction printers. With about 250 pages printed / copies over the past few weeks, the printer has done well.  It was easy to setup on the network and configure drivers on multiple systems. Copying single sided and double sided documents is a breeze.  Copying and printing are both fast.  Quality of print and copy are both good. My main complaint with the printer is that it's a bit louder than my old DEClaser printer.  I understand that there is noise associated with laser printers, but a side by side comparison in terms of noise of my old DEClaser and the new Brother, the Brother is definitely louder. Is it too loud for me, probably not as the printer is in an office room away from any noise concern areas, but still marginally annoying. A good printer, at a good price, with good features...."

Price was what made me take the chance.  I'm extremely happy with my decision.  This machine does everything I need it to do, and more.  I am a loan signing agent, so I print loan documents....and lots of them!  Yes, the other people's comments about popping sounds is true, but it doesn't bother me in the slightest and my printer is right next to my desk.  Performance is excellent!  I've added a second paper tray, and the printer flawlessly selects from the correct tray according to pcl language, to print from the legal paper tray or the letter paper tray.  I can shrink or enlarge copies, fax, scan... it's simply a great asset to my small home business.  Great value for the buck, which is important to me."

Our office staff has been using it mostly for copying and printing. The duplex print feature (which we use a lot) works flawlessly. While shopping for this machine we had read negative reviews specific to it's single page (manual feed) function - for envelopes and label printing. We were pleased to find that the manual feed for label/envelope printing worked flawlessly -the negative reviews were inaccurate. This is an excellent product and the price is very reasonable.

Although advertises that it will scan up to * 1/2 x 11 it does NOT!  It will NOT scan an 1/8"" on each edge.  This may not sound like to big of a problem but if you are routinely scanning documents that are printed to the edges (some checks for example) it is.  There is no work around for this issue and tech support REFUSES to even admit that it is an issue. The ADF also does not pull the pages in correctly, 9 times out of 10 the pages are at an angle. Printing envelopes always crinkles them. This product also failed within the first year of ownership (the fuser failed.)

So I place a call to Brother to see if I can get some sort of customer ""service"" and all I get is a cold ""NO"".  We are not dealing with a $100 printer here and the fact that they were so unwilling to even cover the cost of parts makes me regret ever purchasing a Brother product.  According to Brother, they cover for the first year after purchase or sixteen months after date of manufacturer.  My machine is 18 months out of manufacturing, and 14 months since the date of purchase.  Sure its a bit off but you would think that they would be willing to help out considering its a $500 machine.  Unfortunately, the company has a long way to go in their customer service department. Basically, I would suggest looking into other similar machines with better manufacturer's warranties...it will save you a lot of trouble and money in the long run."

This is a great printer/scanner/fax with full Linux support from the manufacturer!  I was able to get this printer configured (including scanning with SANE and network fax send/receive) in a Linux environment following Brother's Linux setup instructions without any problems at all. I especially appreciate the ""Scan to FTP"" feature which will deliver PDFs to  up to 10 programmable user accounts and directories at the touch of a button (does not require the user to type in user name and password each time like our Xerox machine). This printer has many more network friendly features than described in the  printed documentation so be sure to peruse the Network User's Guide if that kind of thing is important to you. My only complaint (which has been stated in other reviews) is that envelopes get wrinkled by the printer in its default configuration.  The included manual does not address this problem, but the updated manual on the Brother support site does.  Lifting the two blue levers behind the back cover does solve the problem and I've just left them in that position without any apparent ill consequences (the updated manual states that you should return the blue levers to their normal position for non-envelope printing which would be a major inconvenience if you print many envelopes). As far as I can tell, this is an outstanding MFD at an unbelievably good price (especially if you buy the refurbished version).  And did I mention that the manufacturer directly supports Linux for all features of the printer?  :-)  Kudos to Brother for a great printer and quality Linux support."

Scanning documents through the document feeder result in crooked/offset images.  I thought we simply purchased a bad-unit.  But, after returning it for a replacement - we got the same result. The first unit we purchased broken down after about 2 months.  It just started making this really loud clunking sound.  Then it just complained with error messages and wouldn't print. There was a problem with the included software, which caused Scans to fail with error code.  The only way to get a fix for this problem is to call technical support.

I lost only a few minutes getting the fax working.  In that it was on a shared voice line, the manual prompted me to insert five seconds at the beginning of my greeting to allow time for the system to hear the fax tone. After receipt I saw it was the top rated ""All in One"" in the April PC Magazine.

527985,AO2EURP2Y4JZM,0,0,53,B000ET5W6E,4/10/2007,5,5,5,Fantastic Performance and Compatability,"Can't say enough good things about this Brother all-in-one, given its price and features.  (I paid $100 more than the new Amazon price elsewhere a week ago.) I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same.  Super fast prints from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous HP laser. Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy.  What I did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior HP experience. Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and print engine.  No big deal IMHO. Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far:  (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not. Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others. It's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the ADF suck in and out to scan both sides, and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side. UPDATE 1/5/2009: This machine just keeps going and going.  Whether printing duplex reports, or scanning old files to PDF for archiving, printing checks from QuickBooks, copying and faxing, it continues to be just great.  Still plays well with the Macs (10.4.11 and 10.5.6) on the network as well as the PC's (XP Pro SP3).  And, the firmware can be updated from a Mac now, too. Software negative on the Mac is that the OCR (convert scanned image to editable text) does not work with OS 10.5.  Very nice results on Windows though. I've been scanning old documents and shredding them to save space, and things just scan along in the background while I do other work.  The scanned PDFs are high quality, but pretty big though.  (I recommend Adobe Acrobat Pro to reduce their size.  It has an Optimize Scanned PDF command which both straightens (deskews) the image on each page, and then reduces the file size dramatically - making documents small enough to email.) Only weak part is envelopes - they do indeed come out krinkly.  Gave away my old straight-through HP laser which was ideal for envelopes and heavy stock, so just do that stuff on a straight-through Canon i9100 inkjet that I have."

You can scan two-sided documents and print them on both sides of the page or just on one side of the page.  It's very versatile. The scanning works great, too, for a multi-function machine. Envelopes work fine. I haven't tried the fax, because I scan everything into pdf files and then e-mail them. I use this printer at home, but I am sure it would be a great printer for a small office. I would definitely purchase this machine again!  No regrets!"

I bought this for my SoHo to replace a trusty HP all-in-one that finally died. I love its efficiency, quality laser printing and zippiness.  And I agree with others that the noises are no big deal. My computer fan is much louder and more annoying. I do find it difficult to figure out the scan and fax functions and I consider myself fairly savvy.  The ""Presto Page Manager"" thing is nonsensical. The Brother support site is pathetically unhelpful and the Mac firmware is buggy, however the phone support is great. Techs cheerfully had to walk me through a non-intuitive TWAIN acceptance procedure to get the scanner to work.  They acknowledge it's a problem but that the web has yet to address it. I remain mystified by how to access this machine's potential but figure it's always a challenge to master any new device so I still think I made the right choice."
527979,A2MA3UY2P6IN17,1,1,47,B000ET5W6E,3/24/2007,4,4,4,Very good MFC for a home small office,"I purchased this MFC, which is my first, to replace an old HP Laserjet 5P and an old HP Scanjet 3200C.  I also needed a copy machine feature, which I used the scanner for previously.  I chose this printer over a similar HP printer because of the speed (30ppm vs 22ppm) and the number of features.  I received the printer today and it was larger than I thought it would be, but that's no problem at all as I have sufficient space for it.  This printer will be used primarily for printing text documents and programming code.  I also will use it to scan for website development and for copying small documents. I just received the MFC and installed it so this is a preliminary review based on the installation and initial tests.  I had an issue with the installation because I selected the network connection type and the printer was not recognized at first.  I'm not sure if the problem was because I didn't select custom install or that I didn't configure the printer's networking parameters for my network (I thought I would be able to do that remotely similar to my old HP printer server). I uninstalled, setup the IP information on the printer, and re-installed the printer software selecting network and custom install and now things seem to work correctly in regards to connecting to the printer (MFC).  The printer output looks good and much much faster than my old HP 5P.  The scan was very good and acceptable for website images for the sites I develop.  The copy function was also very good.  I love the auto sheet feeder, which is very convenient.  The printer's keypad interface is intuitive and seems easy to use thus far. There is a power issue, which I did expect from some of the reviews that I read before purchasing it.  The lights in my small office (the den of my house) dims when the printer is powered on and when it warms up.  The dimming is noticable, but otherwise caused no issues with my computer system.  I have decided to connect the printer to a separate circuit instead of the one that is closest to it.  I have two circuits in my office; one for computers and the other is the regular house circuit.  You may need to consider this if the dimming is too much of an annoyance. Overall I am very pleased with this MFC.  It does what I wanted and it is very fast compared to my old printer.  The installation wasn't exactly as the manual presented it.  There was tape on many other items than what the manual indicated so look carefully for packing tape before use.  Configuring the printer for network connectivity also wasn't well documented so if you are not familiar with TCP/IP configuration then you could get stuck.  I also loved the scan to file option where you could scan a document/image and have it sent to a particular computer (which is registered with the MFC during installation).  That is a really good feature.  I am glad that I purchased this MFC and I would recommend it to anyone else.  I will update this review as I get more experience with the MFC."

It is quick to warmup and quick to print. Printed output looks great. There is built-in duplex for all modes, so double-sided operations are quite easy. In fax mode the copies are scanned quickly into memory then sent after a phone connection is made. A key point is also the fact that scanning requires nothing special. I considerd the HP 3055 but it cannot scan via the network; the 3055 requires a USB cable to be connected in addition to the network cable. The Brother does not have that requirement. This printer is highly recommended."
527977,A2X3847AH7VZE2,0,1,45,B000ET5W6E,4/2/2007,5,6,7,The best AIO I've ever had,"I got my first HP OfficeJet 600 in the mid '90s and it was a nice unit. From that point forward I stuck with HPs and they got progressively worse. HP hardware is great but their software has become atrocious. The last HP AIO I had installed a freeware webserver (Tomcat) on my machine and this software caused reloads to be doggedly slow. I moved to my home office full time and needed an AIO with a flat bed so I could copy/scan odd sized documents. Costco was selling the Brother so I did some research on it and it appears to get good marks so I purchased one. First let me say that I did buy a Brother AIO years ago for home and it was so cheap I quickly returned it. I was gun shy about getting another and would have returned it at the first hint of a problem. I must say it has ended up being the best AIO I've ever owned and I've had it for well over a year now. All functionality works correctly and the interface to my PC works well. The software that resides on the PC doesn't have any quirks and loads quickly at boot time. My favorite attribute of the Brother AIO is how fast it scans B&W docs. The HPs did < 10 pages a minute. The brother is cranking at just a couple of seconds / page (this is not true in gray scale or color). My only complaints with this unit are that when it is scanning the software keeps popping up over what you are doing so you can't use your PC when it is scanning (HP did this too, but it scanned so slowly you could get some work in between the times it took away focus), and that the copy quality isn't as good as it was with the HPs. Hardware reliability has been fine. I probably print about 2 reams a month and scan roughly 100 pages a month. I'm on the 3rd or 4th toner cartridge. Everything still functions. My only disappointment is that I thought this unit has the ability to scan both sides of a document and I found out I had to buy a much more expensive unit to do that. I don't have to do this very often so it was cheaper to just copy the back sides of such documents, reassemble them, and then scan them."

All functions that I use work fine with both mac and pc. I use both platforms.  The toner lasts a good long time and you can make it last even longer by lowering to draft quality when you don't need full quality. In fact, there is nothing bad I can say about this printer.  It is a fast, reliable and efficient workhorse, and has never given me any problems.  I totally recommend this as one of the best small office machines I've ever encountered."

This printer actually gets fairly light usage (less than 50 pages/day) , as most of our regular black and white printing gets done through a faster HP Laserjet printer. However, we have had to use the Brother as the primary printer when the Laserjet has problems, and it's performed just as admirably under 500 pages/day. The main reasons we chose to replace our previous Brother multifunction had less to do with the printer we previously had, and more to do with a few key features in this model: - Networkable The 8860DN can be networked very easily, once you understand the process. Unfortunately, the documentation on this isn't very good, but if you know (or google) the steps to add a network printer to a computer, it's very easy. The real benefit of networking is that you can scan from the printer to an individual desktop. If you press the SCAN button on the printer, you use the standard scan profiles (resolution, color, etc). If you press a SCAN button on the Brother software on the desktop instead, you can have a personalized profile for each desktop. I wish they made it easier to store the personalized profiles on the actual printer - it's fine if the printer is near the computer, but a pain to go back and forth if it's far (put document on printer, walk to desktop, press scan button, walk to printer, retrieve document, go back to desktop). - Fax to Server: This is the real benefit, and probably why I'll get the printer again for our other office. If you use Internet Fax (where you send/receive faxes by email, instead of over the phone line), this is a real time saver. Brother's Fax to Server lets you send a fax-by-email directly from the printer, instead of having to scan, save, create email, and attach document at your desktop. It acts more like a traditional fax. Once it's set up, just punch in the fax number and it will automatically email your document to something like [faxnumber]@faxservice.com (or however you set it up). I believe you can only choose to use the Fax to Server OR the traditional fax. You can't use both. The printer can also monitor an email address and print out attachments directly, but I haven't used this service yet. - Fast.. kind of. At 30 ppm, the Brother is fairly speedy, but not the fastest printer in our office. It's a decent speed for what we use it for, but I wouldn't want to use it every day for heavy usage -- I'd rather have a faster dedicated printer for higher levels of printing. We rely on our internet fax services a lot, so this printer has made a big difference. However, there are a couple cons that I really wish Brother would address. - Paper tray: The 250 tray is kind of paltry for daily usage. There is an optional 250 page add-on tray available at a msrp of $200 each (maximum 2 add-ons), but I wish the printer came with at least a 500 page tray built-in. Its so much easier being able to dump a 500 page ream into one tray, than trying to balance out the load between two trays or figuring out where to store a half-used ream. - Toner: Brother toners are great in that they're cheap, because they don't include a drum unit. You just pull out the cartridge from the existing drum and replace. However, that also means replacing the toner can be messy. Also, Brother units are notorious for giving very short notice regarding toner life. Once it's out, it's out - no shaking the cartridge for another hundred pages, even though there is physically enough toner."

I have the other at my home and I will agree that it is very noisy, but who cares?  It's a printer, not a Cadillac.  The noise lets you know it's working.  The consumables for this printer are reasonably priced for how long they last.  It is letting me know that I am nearing the end of my first drum, so that lasted over a year of hard use.  The Brother software works well on PC and Mac, I have mine networked through both.  Scans and copies letter and legal, but you have to set up through the software.  I have mine set up that if I use the buttons on the printer (which is more common) it scans letter, but if I use the software buttons, it scans legal.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this printer and I have been seriously underwhelmed by printers my whole life.  It's a big, medium volume printer for a heavily used home office or equivalent.  If you have this need, this is the printer for you."

It turns out to be an awesome printer as many other reviews have noted, which was my reasoning for purchasing this model and brand.  I have never owned any products by Brother, but the company seems to produce quality products. Should you be interested in purchasing this printer, the only con I'd have to say it has it it's paper tray.  I believe it only holds 50 sheets, which at a small-business, they get consumed very quickly.  So, you (and we) may want to consider purchasing the additional optional paper tray so you don't have to refill the tray as much.  Or, save money and don't let the frequency of adding paper bother you."

When it was time to get an upgrade, I stick with this Brother.  The price might be steep compare to other Brother products or similar products but it's well worth it for the features it offers.  I am especially impressed with the print speed, duplex printing, duplex faxing and receive, and duplex scanning.  I don't believe I can find any other printers that offer the same feature in the similar price range.  I think given proper normal care, this printer will last me another 7 years. Highly recommend!"

No Problems. Scanner speed is pretty average.  The noise the machine makes on warm-up is not bothersome to me; since this noise is much less than what my HP deskjet produces during it's print time. Print time is very fast. Fax quality is very good. I would like to be able to tone down the incoming fax volume though because I always get those junk faxes in the middle of the night and it can be annoying.  Otherwise I Love This Machine!!!
527965,A2RCR4IM7XA0CJ,0,0,33,B000ET5W6E,3/24/2007,5,2,2,Brother 8860 Printer,This printer produces quality printing and copies. It was very easy to set up. From the box to set up took less than 10 minutes. The duplexing feature was very important to me and works fine. I also added the extra draw which gave me 500 pages and so far this works fine. Ordering from Amazon was great as always. The product arrived the next day even though I did not pay for express shipping. I saw a lower price a few days later from Amazon and they adjusted the price with a credit to my charge card. Faxing on this printer is very easy. The automatic document feature works just fine. This printer replaced an HP Laser which was great and a brother fax machine which was also trouble free. The brother 8860 had some extra features that the new HP lacked and this was the deciding factor for ordering the 8860 as opposed to the HP 3390. You really can't go wrong with either one.

It has everything I need - copier, network print, scan, fax.  Easy setup (I am in IT for 25+ years).  Everything was almost perfect.  The only complaint you need to keep in mind - IT EATS 1100 WATTS when starts printing - light could flash. It was OK, until I reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3"".  No problem - need to clean everything (per my experience and confirmed on Brother's web site).  Cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page. Called Support 2 times.  After few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace DRUM.  Hey - its only 1500 pages, nowhere close to promised 25000!  After I mentioned it, they offered me 75% discount on it.  What's about warranty?  Sorry.  I spoke to supervisor, he explained that Support in Philippines can't do it, the only option - to call USA office. I replaced DRUM.  Now counter shows around 2000 pages and I have same problem again. Hey, I heard this before - never say never.  Still as of today: I would NEVER, NEVER buy Brother printer/MFC again!!!"

Users seem to be able to easily access the various functions without instruction.  Print and scan functions on the network were easy to set up with multiple computers in two locations being able to access the Brother.  It does print envelopes but as has been noted in other reviews, causes folds and creases in the envelopes.  I haven't been able to get the scan quality on photos to equal our dedicated HP scanner, but that just might be 'operator error.'"

I suppose for most people it would be OK, but for me 90% of its jobs were to be printing a specific type of graphic from one particular program. I could not get it to look good-lines were too light. Brother gave me little to no help and said it was a problem with my software (I could print fine to other printers).

Everything advertised on this printer works: copying, faxing, scanning, printing. The printer does take a few minutes to warm up after it wakes up from sleep mode. Setup is a breeze in Windows XP and Fedora 9 (works with older MFC drivers also) Gone is the problem of the past where you turn on the printer as in the MFC-8840DN it will dim your lights. This one is energy star and is improved. The printer quality is excellent, just as if you are printing like any other document from any other printer. No too lite prints problems in the previous past version. I wish Brother would also do fixes with firmware updates. I know HP does that to support the product after purchase but Brother doesn't from their website. I would be great if Brother still adds and fixes bugs with firmware updates after purchase. I usually need a big glass screen to scan the bigger documents so having the 9x14 definately helps. Many printer companies has been producting lesser Multi-function printers without the bigger screens nowadays to cut corners. The color MFC from brother doesn't have the screen also. So I recommend to always get the bigger glass screen, you will never know if you need them to scan or copy a big piece of paper 1 day. Overall, I recommend this MF to anyone. Amazon has the best time for service and price as well."
527958,A3AARVXFCM4GER,0,1,26,B000ET5W6E,12/12/2008,4,1,1,Great Machine,"Bought our first one 2 years ago.  An excellent machine.  The only flaw is that the fuser/laser component only lasts for 100,000 copies and costs $200 for the part, so $300 total installed.  You can buy the machine for $500-$550 so obviously, Brother intends you to buy new.  It took us 2 years to print 100,000 pages.  When I added up the cost including the machine, drums, and toners, our total cost for 2 years/100,000 copies was $2600.  Had I done the same usage with an ink jet, it would have cost about $5000-$6000, so most definitely this is the better buy.  We would like to see the print speed of this one combined with color laser, in an all in one, but so far, that isn't happening.  So we bought a new machine, same model, and maybe in 2 years, the color laser will be a viable purchase."

It takes half an hour to scan a 22 page document. Even with the lowest resolution, the document is 11.4 megabytes which means it is too big to send via email to most addresses. Plus, you can't continue to work on the computer while it is scanning. After each page the scanner software pops up and you have to keep clicking back to where you were to continue. Sometimes, if you are typing and the software pops up, the whole scan process stops. As for the faxing and copying-no problems there. Works like a charm!"

For some reason the ""No Paper"" warning comes up on a constant basis-- there is a full ream in the tray!  I have to reboot everything & call Brother to dicker with it & get it cleared.  I've had loud banging noises upon paper reload.  I've had End of Drum is near, right after replacing the drum.  The manual feed (single feed/envelope) tray needs babying and manual set up every damn time.  I don't like the fact that I can't get an automatic fax confirmation, like I could with my HP unit.  It is an enormously complex and non-user friendly item that needs constant babying.  I bought a lemon & shame on [...] for getting into this piece of junk.  It is a small-office nightmare.

It's set up as a printer, scanner, copier, and fax hooked up by USB cable to a desktop computer and configured as a shared printer. We also have a telephone with answering machine connected in case someone calls our fax number by mistake, or if we want to use the fax phone line to make a call. The scanner is set to save scans onto a network drive, so users can scan their documents and access them from their own computers. The MFC can also be configured to transmit faxes from any computer on the network, although I have not tried this feature. The biggest problem so far was that we originally used the Windows share name to connect to the network printer, i.e. \\computer\printer. This method for connecting to the network share proved unreliable, so we configured the desktop to have a static IP address and used that to connect to the printer, i.e. \\192.168.100.60\printer. We also had a problem receiving faxes when the answering machine on the connected telephone filled up, so that the telephone never picked up. Neither of these problems was the fault of the Brother MFC, but be aware that configuring all the features of the MFC may take some in-depth knowledge, time, and troubleshooting. Offices with a small volume of printing can get by with this unit alone. Offices with a high volume of printing may want to consider an additional unit dedicated to printing which is designed to handle a high volume of printouts at minimal expense."

My goal was to put together a duplex document scanner, a super-large hard drive for my PC, and a great shredder. I would scan the papers needing filing, their images would be automatically saved onto the hard drive, then I would shred the originals. The Fellowes 3227901 shredder and the Cavalry 1TB USB/eSATA Hard Drive fit the bill perfectly, and I gave both high ratings. The Brother MFC-8860DN was another story. Although I have very happily owned Brother products in the past---in fact, I was replacing an older Brother MFD and a Brother laser printer---this device fell far below my expectations. It claims to scan at 300x300, 600x600, and 1200x1200, and it claims to save in JPEG and PDF. It does all of those things---but it scans SOOOO slowly it completely removed my ability to make my process quick and easy. I am forced to scan at 300x300; anything higher takes about 2-4 minutes per side. Even at 300x300 I have to wait while each document scans, which could take anywhere from 2 minutes to 4 minutes for a multi-page two-sided document. If I get three such documents to scan each day, well...you do the math. For what I paid for this, I would have expected much quicker scanning. I'm going to keep it because there weren't many other choices that would serve my purpose, but I will probably replace it very soon in the future after I forget how much I paid for it."

Prepare to press buttons needlessly until you decide that scanning isn't worth it: To scan to file you'll have to press a lot of buttons and wait a loooong time. 1. Put the document on ADF 2. Press scan button if it's not already selected 3. press down button FIVE times to select scan to file 4. press OK 5. press down button to select duplex L side 6. press OK 7. press down button if necessary to select which PC (I've only configured one but it still wants me to confirm 8. press OK to select 9. Then it can't find my machine on the network...I'm not going to debug this since I'm going to send it back. Did I mention the really loud, annoying beeps for all ELEVEN button presses? All the many unnecessary scanning functions are controlled by up-down arrows and the OK button. There's no way to assign a default to one of the many useless buttons on the nearly overwhelming front panel. The UI is really set up for faxing--lots of buttons to store address book...but who faxes any more? Did I mention that the scanner is really slow (initiated scan from PC) since it pulls the paper through the ADF THREE times (even though there's only two sides of the page)? 23 seconds per page on black and white 300dpi! Did I mention that this is the loudest scanner I've ever heard. It's louder than the printer and the printer's really loud. I'm not just being sensitive here--it's a lot louder than the Brother 1670N (also a duplex laser printer) this was supposed to replace. I was hoping for a replacement for my fujitsu fi-4120c sheetfed duplex scanner but there's absolutely no comparison."

When making multiple copies of a page (like 9 copies) or when printing a document of about 15-20 pages, the machine makes an audible alarm noise while printing. Brother customer support says this is normal, and is due to the fuser expanding and contracting.

527929,AYUOQCCV2F8LU,0,0,803,B000ETVKHE,6/9/2006,4,169,171,Some notes about the e200 series,"The other reviews have already commented on the features and performance, so I'll try to comment on those aspects that haven't gotten much attention. This is a great player, but I will concentrate on some annoying aspects: 1. When you charge via USB, the display on the device is always on. It doesn't fall asleep or go dim. The device is also nonresponsive in this mode, ie the buttons won't work and you won't be able to play or do anything. 2. If you have a USB wall charger, the display will dim and the buttons will work while charging. But the device must be on, it won't charge via AC if the device is turned off. 3. Playlists can be made on the fly, but you have to play each song you want to add to the playlist in order to bring up the option. 4. Video conversion software only installs on windows XP. It also breaks up larger files into smaller ones, and it's not very intuitive to copy whole DVD's. The quicktime format it uses is proprietary. Also, video files are only recognized in the root folder, so the device won't see files located in subfolders. Videos run at 15 fps. 5. Has the option of choosing MSC or MTP mode. MSC loads the player like a flash drive so you manually drag and drop files. MTP works with wmp 10, and some other third party software to manage your syncing. I prefer MSC, but I switched to MTP because when you unplug the USB cable in MSC mode, the device reboots itself. It does not do this is MSC mode. This is a great player, but you'll need to spend some time configuring everything to your preferences. The Sandisk firmware has good basic functionality, but if you're used to lots of features for customization, be prepared to work for it with this device. I miss features like ""play most recently synchronized"" that my old player had. The good news is that these firmware drawbacks may soon be addressed when Rockbox firmware is released. The hardware and build quality of this device is truly excellent, and it will be the best flash player on the market once Rockbox firmware is released for the e200 series."
527928,A2LHCQOP2B7ZNT,0,0,802,B000ETVKHE,11/27/2006,5,122,124,Cheaper (and better) option to the Nano,"I've owned a 3rd generation iPod for quite a few years now and decided it was time to upgrade to something newer. The iPod Nano was one of my top choices, but then I found this item and decided to give it a try. It offered much more features (FM radio, voice recording, video, photos) for a lower price. The negative reviews and stories of it breaking soon after purchase made me wary, but I hoped they were just rare occurrences and got one anyways. 1)Music One of the great features of the Sansa is that it allows you to drag and drop music files right into the drive in MSC mode and it'll find and play it after a restart. No need for iTunes or any other complicated jukebox program. If you would rather use a music program, it can be set to sync with a Windows Media Player library in MTP mode. I did notice that the only way to put user made playlists on the Sansa is to use Media Player and select a pre-made playlist in the sync options. When browsing through music, the typical options of searching through albums, artists, genre, or songs are available. One problem I found was that browsing through songs in a playlist slightly lags compared to browsing through other options. I like organizing my music in playlists so this bothered me. While listening, the repeat, shuffle, and equalizer options are only a few clicks away. One problem, however, is that you can't scroll to any place in the song. The available options are pause, skip, fast forward, and rewind. Similarly to the iPod, the scroll wheel becomes the volume control. The difference is that the Sansa resets the volume to 50 every time you turn off the player. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future firmware update. As for music quality, I was quite impressed with the sound. My music sounded as good if not better than my 3G iPod. For the record, all of my music is in mp3 format of 192 to 320kbps. The included earbuds are okay, I'm not a big fan of earbuds. 2)Radio The FM radio is a nice feature to have when you're tired with your music and want to hear something fresh. Reception from the Sansa isn't the best, but some stations still sound good if they have a strong signal. The player allows you to create your own presets or it can browse and make some for you. The ability to record radio is a nice addition for those times you want to remember a song you don't know the name to. 3)Video Watching video on a 1.8"" screen might seem pointless, but I very surprised by the quality of video the Sansa produced. I first tried converting a seven minute, DivX encoded music video using the Sansa Media Converter, but the program crashed when loading the file. To remedy this, I first converted the file to MOV using a free encoder then used the Sansa program on the MOV file. The result was a 416x304 DivX file (131mb) to a 160x208 QuickTime movie (118mb). The final file is quite large considering it's about half in resolution and frames per second (29.97 to 15fps) as the original. Nonetheless, the video looked and sounded perfect compared to the original (just quite small). Being able to carry videos with you to watch whenever you want is certainly a cool factor. As with music, one grievance is the inability to scroll to any point in the video. The only controls available during playback are fast forward, rewind, pause, skip, and volume control. 4)Photos The Media Converter can handle most picture formats and convert them to something friendly with the Sansa. I haven't tried adding photos of my own, but the sample photos look nice. 5)Voice Recording I tested the voice recording feature during lecture in one of my classes. I sat in the 9th row and the professor was using a mic. However, her voice still sounded muffled in the recording. The recorder does seem to be able to record voices at a close distance fairly well. Another drawback is that the output file is in 16bit wave format. Voice recording is a nice feature, but you shouldn't expect too much from it. 6)Style The Sansa looks great, even better than the black iPod Nano in my opinion. The mechanical scroll wheel does feel a bit cheap, but I guess I'm just used to using the electrostatic touchpad of an iPod. The buttons are small if you have large hands and they are somewhat hard to press. I have to sometimes use the tip of my nails to press down. It would have been nice if the buttons were raised slightly higher, but it might ruin the Sansa's sleek look. The included pouch looks nice with the player and is certainly better than getting nothing. There is also an included lanyard that can be attached to the player. Finally, the screen is very bright and its colors vivid, even on the lowest brightness settings. Videos and photos look quite good on it despite the screen size. 7)Other Notes I was able to get about 15 hours of use from my initial charge. It's less than the advertised amount, but came fairly close. Charging the battery does seem to be a bit of a hassle since it must be connected to a computer via USB. It would have been nice if they just included an adapter to let you charge with a wall outlet. Finally, more memory can be added with microSD cards, which is a cheaper alternative to upgrading to a model with more capacity. Overall, the Sansa is a great audio player with some nice features. There may be some bugs, but hopefully some of them can be fixed in future firmware updates. It may not have the fame of an iPod, but sells itself through its looks and functionality. PRO: Price (cheaper than iPod Nano for same amount of storage) Extras (FM radio, video, photo, voice recording) Drag and drop to add files Looks great More memory can be added CONS: Hard to press buttons Lag when browsing playlist No included wall charger Volume resets to 50 every time it's turned off"

The 4GB Ipod Nano that The Sansa e260 competes with costs $230.  That should be enough of a reason to buy this amazing player for nearly half that amount (I paid $130). My second biggest gripe with the Ipod is the batteries.  They are not user-servicable, and in a couple of years when they die (as they all do) you will have to ship your Nano to Apple and pay them to replace it.  The Sansa has a user replaceable battery kit for around $13. Also, the Nano doesn't play video.  The Sansa e200 series will convert and play many different kinds of video files.  I just loaded 2 full length features and a full season of my favorite TV show and still had enough room fo about 15 CDs.  That should be enough to keep me distracted on a long road trip i have planned. Lastly, if you have an Ipod, you have to use iTunes to load your music.  Personally, i hate to be forced into using proprietary software in order to use a device.  The Sansa lets you drag and drop files directly onto the device in Windows explorer.  You have the option to use Windows Media Player if you want to set up Playlists, etc. Other features that the Sansa has that the Ipod doesn't even offer are the radio tuner with 25 presets and autoscan (which works perfectly), a voice and radio recorder (great for important meetings or just a grocery list). There are a couple of small cons with the Sansa e200 players.  The wheel is mechanical and isn't sealed well, and I can see it eventually getting lint, dust, etc. in it if you don't buy a separate case.  I have not had this problem, I just see this as a possible future problem. Also, you can't use the device while it is plugged in to your computer.  You can, however, use the device while it is plugged into an AC or car adaptor, so you can simply buy a cheap multi-adapter (with both a car and AC plug) and problem solved. Even if you purchase the most expensive case and plug adapter on the market, you will still end up spending much less than you would have spent on a Nano. In conclusion, if you like to throw money away on expensive players with virtually no features, by all means, get the Nano.  If you are a conscientious shopper who would rather have a player loaded with features and $100 in your pocket, go with the Sansa."
527926,A2U0TAE7YSZPK4,0,1,800,B000ETVKHE,4/14/2007,3,56,57,Player is good -- software not so good,"MAN!! I finally was able to figure out how to overcome all the obstacles SanDisk mounts for a non-geek user. The obstacles: 1) The manual included with the player is close to worthless. The one included on the CD is better though, as mentioned elsewhere, is not exactly normal user friendly. 2) Plug in the player to your computer (mine is Win-2000 3+ year-old desktop) after, of course, you figure out where that might be. (Well, ok, not so hard, right next to the plug for my iPod.) 3) Great. Now I can load some songs! I go to Windows explorer to see if I can see the new removeable drive show up. Nope. Mine didn't. So I downloaded the recommended software -- Rhapsody. Can Rhapsody see it? Nope. Tried this and that, looked at the doc and finally called Tech Support. After a minorly tense conversation, I finally understand that the help desk person wanted me to change the USB setting from the default MTP setting to ""MSC"". Success!! Ok -- that's nice I can see if from Explorer, but I can't see it in Rhapsody, still, after disconnecting, reconnecting, etc. What do I do now Ms. Help Desk? Try it on another computer, she says. Nice.:( 4) After several hours Googling this problem, reading at forums, trying other stuff, I finally hit upon a ""Music Manager"" that works!!! Yay! So, I hope you might save some of the time I wasted with trying to make Rhapsody work and waiting for SanDisk to get back to me, etc, etc. Go to the Media Monkey site [...] and try out this terrific piece of freeware that (for me, at least) works very well. I still have to address the ""playlist"" hurdle but I'll leave that for the morning. I'm satisfied with the player, sound, price, replaceable battery. But until I found Media Monkey, I was planning to return it to Amazon in the morning. (Honestly, if I knew then what I know now, I'd have bought another nano because iTunes is pretty easy.) Dianne"
527924,AAPD8AW5GBP9F,0,0,798,B000ETVKHE,9/3/2006,5,33,33,Great player especially with a subscription service,"I purchased the 4G device, and was so pleased that a week later I purchased a second 6G player for my wife. I read of lot of the reviews here on Amazon, which helped me make the decision to go with the Sansa. I think most features have been covered, I just thought I would add a few tips for people considering this mp3 player. When I got the player it came with a flyer offering a 1 month free trial for Rhapsody To Go. I had been thinking I would go with Yahoo subscription service, because for years I have not been a fan of Real whose marketing tactics I have deplored. In any event the offer got me to do some reasearch about the various subscription services, and the consensus seemed to be that Rhapsody offered the most features, although it was a bit higher priced. So I did sign up with Rhapsody for the To Go service, using the one month free trial offer. I can report that I could not be more pleased with the service. The subscription model puts another nail in the iPod coffin as far as I'm concerned, and given Sandisk's aggressive pricing for this player I agree with the Engadget guys that there isn't any reason to go with the Nano. Now the caveats, and tips. I've not used an iPod and iTunes, but from what I read it is pretty bulletproof. The subscription model and combination of the Sansa e200 series with Rhapsody works great for me...I've got 3 computers authorized and two Sansa players. I've had zero problems with DRM...but if you read the forums there are folks who have definitely had DRM renewal issues. It's my feeling that the latest versions of Rhapsody and Sansa firmware have got most issues under control. So when you get your Sansa player, immediately go to the Sandisk website and download the firmware updater program and update the firmware on the player...I received my player a week ago, and at that time it did do a firmware update. Remember to set the USB connection (under settings on the player) to MSC instead of MTP for the update. There are two ways to connect to the player and normally you will use MTP mode, but not for the firmware update. Another point, when I tried to move a playlist created in Rhapsody to the Sansa in MTP mode it wouldn't transfer over as advertised...although the songs in the playlist were moved over. When I connected later in MSC mode the playlist automatically moved to the player. I will assume a further firmware or program update will take care of this issue down the road. Also Rhapsody recently updated their software, so if you are not just now installing the Rhapsody software I would update their software before plugging in the Sansa. Another important point is that if you uninstall and then reinstall the Rhapsody software, make sure to 'deauthorize' the computer before you uninstall the software. The reason is that you are only allowed to authorize 3 computers (you can only be logged on to the service on one at a time though) and you will use up one of those if you don't deauthorize it before the uninstall. (You can get Real to re-set your list if you make this mistake, but it sounds like a bit of a hassle.) And if you are going to uninstall the software go to their site and search the forums for instructions on how to do a complete uninstall. Of the three installations of Rhapsody I performed, one didn't go right and I had to re-do it, but after the second install it worked fine. Sorry if you think I spent too much time talking about Rhapsody, but my point is that when I purchased the player I assumed I would only use it to play music I already owned that was on my computer. After experiencing the subscription music model (whatever service you go with), I am blown away by how much it adds to the entire experience of the Sansa. I've been waiting for a long time to find an mp3 player that would give Apple some competition and finally, this is the one!"
527922,A2Y63G8F6EISHM,0,1,796,B000ETVKHE,6/22/2006,5,23,23,"e260 vs Nano - an easy decision, heres why","I recently purchased a new nano for my fiancee, and one of the e260 for myself.  My thought was that I wanted to buy her a nice expensive unit, and I would settle for the less expensive unit.  However, it turns out that the e260 is way better than the Nano.  I'll break down why, and to be fair there is a couple of things also listed that the Nano does better. THINGS THAT e260 DOES BETTER THAN NANO: 1.) e260 can do more - You can play video on the e260 - great for little vacation clips from your camera. 2.) e260 screen is bigger, more colorful and brighter 3.) e260 battery is replaceble, no need to throw your unit away when the battery dies (since apple ipod would charge too much to send it in and get battery etc). 4.) Price per Storage ratio.  Nano cost $175 for 2GB, e260 was $140 for 4GB (prices at my purchase time) Thats TWICE AS MUCH for LESS MONEY. 5.) e260 is more scratch and break resistant.  Built better. 6.) e260 has an FM TUNER, you can listen to radio! 7.) You cannot use a coupon or coupon code on any Apple products at any store anywhere, you can with e260. 8.) e260 has memory card slot, yes you can add even more storage and/or move stuff off/on with a little micro-sd card. 9.) Battery charge - you get at least a couple of hours more from full charge out of the e260. 10.) Drag and drop your music onto the unit, no need for management software.  This means the unit can also be used as a file storage device like a USB drive. THINGS THAT NANO DOES BETTER THAN e260: 1.) Nano is slightly thinner. 2.) Nano has more accessories on the market, its hard to find them for e260. 3.) The scroll wheel of e260 is mechanical, the nano scroll is sort of touch based.  Some prefer the mechanical, but the touch based is prefered by me. Its no contest for me, I will never buy IPOD again, you just do not get what you pay for.  Really, if there was an IPOD Nano out there with the same features as the e260 and same storage space, apple would charge over $500 for it."
527921,A177AVUF1JE6A8,0,0,795,B000ETVKHE,11/22/2006,4,22,22,"Good MP3 player, but needs some tweaking to be great","I recently purchased the E260 on Amazon, and I am relatively happy with the purchase.  The E260 is a nice music and FM radio player, has good sound, and has a decent user interface.  I find it easier to use than the Creative Micro that I used to have.  I do not have problems with the buttons (and I have large fingers), and I find the movable wheel very useful.  The touch sensitive bar on the Creative was too sensitive and difficult to operate. My major use of a MP3 player is during commuting to work.  I listen to the radio above ground and to podcasts and music below ground in the subway.  The E260 is great for both functions -- the FM radio reception is actually quite good, better than my Creative Micro and an older RCA Lyra. The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the software on the player is missing some functionalities that SanDisk should fix in future Firmware upgrades.  First, it would be nice to return back to the song that you had been listening to before you switch to FM.  The player requires you to go back through the menu steps to find the song again.  It does save what you had chosen before, so all you have to do is press select over and over again.  If it remembers these choices, it would seem a logical step to put you back at the actual song again without the menu steps?  Second, the player is missing a bookmark capability.  This is a big issue if you want to use the player to listen to audio books.  Third, the fast forward only steps forward by 5 seconds or so each push of the fast forward or if you hold it down longer.  The Creative Micro accelerates the speed of the fast forward the longer you hold down the button.  A similar functionality would be nice.  Otherwise, it takes too much effort to advance to where you are in a long podcast or long audio book."
527920,AH9MUK2Z52V6N,0,1,794,B000ETVKHE,11/21/2006,4,20,20,First MP3 player I ever owned and not disappointed,"I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player. Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues. I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more. As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot. I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre. It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it. I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics. Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod."
527919,A8IC4AYQRG3SV,0,1,793,B000ETVKHE,9/16/2006,4,18,18,A Very Nice Player,"I've owned several Sandisk players. If you want a low cost player with reasonable capacity and an easy AAA battery choice, Sandisk has been the way to go. Now they have moved way up in class, with the E200 series. These players have a great color screen, more advanced navigation, and lithium batteries that can be user replaced by removing 4 screws. Sandisk sells them for [...]. If you have a 4GB player, you have to be able to find things. When I first got the player, it didn't 'find' the 'genres' of my music files, which is one easy way to categorize. Fortunately, when I did a firmware update, the genres showed up. If you want to create (genre or other) categories for your music, you can use something like Jetaudio to label many 'selected' files, all at once, by the way. This player also sorts by album, and the tracks on the album are in the correct order. Again, this is information in the tag, so the tags have to be done correctly. Most 'ripping' programs do this, at least for mp3's. Aside from genre, the E200 sorts by artist, and title. The scroll wheel is quite fast, and the bright screen makes seeing where you are much easier than previous Sandisk players. The sound is solid and it seems quite clean with a good pair of headphones. It will drive good phones, which are often less efficient. This is a good player, especially with the rebates. I use drag and drop, and I loaded this player completely in less than half an hour. The size is just about perfect. If it were thinner, it wouldn't really fit anywhere that it doesn't already fit. The screen size is very good, but maybe not for video. It looks like a solid piece of equipment. I never had problems with other Sandisk players, but they looked flimsy. Also, this one looks much more elegant. If you upgrade the firmware once, future updates should be automatic. When I drag and drop files with good tag info, I can navigate to the artists and the songs without any hitch. Tags are what makes iTunes work, and this player seems to do a good job, as long as you have good tags. If not, try a program like Godfather. It's great to see a player that looks good, sounds good, and holds a bunch of music. All for a price that is more than reasonable. I like this player so much I wish I had the 8GB version, but maybe I will get a miniSD card. I don't like handing out 5 starts, but I think this is 4 and a half. The USB charging is a little limited. I did find that a cheap 4AA USB adapter works fine and charges it. But you still have a special cable you must have with you. But that is a small drawback."
527918,AT3NRCGB6G8DA,0,0,792,B000ETVKHE,12/7/2006,4,17,17,Good Choice for Price,"I bought this because I needed something to hold enough music to keep me occupied on a long flight. I managed to actually see a few different players before I bought this one, and it is probably the best choice for both the price range and capacity. Whats Good: - Can play music & video and store photo images - Has FM radio but then who cares? - Good battery life - Expansion card slot - Nice price Whats Not So Good: - Need to convert photo and video using Sansa S/W (bundled) - The USB dock connector seems to be propritary - They don't include an AC adapter in the package - Can't find any customizable EQ features As always there will be some improvements that can be made, but then the same thing can be said for more expensive players too.  Is the sound quality the best on the market?  I doubt it, but I think for the price you really can't go wrong with it. Spend the time sorting out your music play lists first before you start moving music over.  I didn't and discovered that everything just went into one large folder so I had to start over. Play lists make sense, so it's worth spending the time to figure out what works for you beforehand. I have probably 500 songs and I have used half of the stated storage capacity which is about where I should be based on the product specifications. This would also be a great choice for general use (to and from the office) or maybe working out at the gym. If you had planned to spend around $130.00 (at the time of this review) then it's a great choice. Maybe you won't look as cool as the guy with the iPod, but then look at what he paid for a 4GB player. Get it."

Simply plug up and drag files onto your player.  The ipod can only be loaded through I-tunes (Apples specific software for IBM compatible machines). I really dislike the I-tunes software. It is clumsy and not very user friendly. It does not have the look, feel, functionality of your typical windows or MS Office type applications. 2. The Sansa cost was much less than my ipod Nano while offering greater functionality (movies, pictures, and 4 GB's not including the expansion card option). 3. The ipod Nano has superior sound quality. No question. 4. The Ipod standard headphones are a higher quality. Not only the sound, but the construction. The headphone wire is much thicker and they generally feel more rugged. 5. The Sansa holds more than music. Pictures, FM radio, movie clips. The Ipod Nano is only a music player.  I realize that Ipod has other models that do more, but the price tag also increases. 6. Ipod converts files to a .AAC format. No, you can not share music files without the conversion done with itunes. 7. Lastly, Ipod has superior accessories. They have hundreds of options for cases, mounting fixtures, color skins, etc.  Sansa has limited accessories. Based on this review, I hope you can choose the best one for you. Personally, all things considered, the Sansa was the best choice for me. I am use to the windows style file system and really like features for the cost. People really into accessories would probably prefer Ipod."

I purchased it to test it out while the e270 was on backorder and I have been pretty impressed what it can do. What I like about my Sansa e260: -Audio/photo/video playback is excellent -Small in size but thicker than the iPod Nano (the Nano in my opinion is a tad too thin) -Large screen and good photo/video quality for something its size. It's not top of the line, but my coworkers and I have been impressed with the screen quality. I've watched videos on it with no problem -Nifty blue glowing dial -Ease of use. Most of it was self explanatory though a ""quick guide"" was included in the box -Battery life. Even playing videos, I was able to get 10+ hours before the battery was too low. -Expandable memory (micro SD card, which I will soon purchase) -Comes with conversion software for photos and video Things I don't like about my Sansa e260: -Lack of accessories. I did have to hunt down my player but if you walk into any store you can see that it is an iPod dominated market. I was only able to find a silicon case for it but hopefully this will change over the next few weeks -Lack of AC charger. Only a USB changer was available as is in the iPod, however I have been unable to locate a OEM or aftermarket AC charger. Hopefully this will change but until then I use a USB/AC adapter -Expandable memory slot will play mp3s only, not photos or video -Attracts finger prints like crazy. Somehow the oils on your finger tips show up on both the black and metal parts of the player. I expected it on the front but not on the liquid metal. -Radio works but doesn't get the best reception on all stations -Conversion software will split large video files into smaller shorter clips (~10 min clips) which results in short pauses as it goes to the next file Is it the iPod Nano killer? Yes and no. I think it's a wonderful flash player with many features the Nano lacks (but some can be added on) for a comparable price. If you are an avid iPod fan you may not like the tactile wheel. I love the photo and video playback and am impressed with the screen, which is larger than the Nano's. I would suggest finding a vender and testing it out before you purchase it. Although it is thicker than the Nano, it has an impressive battery life even with video playback and the battery is user replacable. I am satified with my Sansa e260 and think it's worth checking out if you're looking for a flash player with many features."
527915,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0,0,789,B000ETVKHE,3/17/2007,4,13,13,great video and audio,"I wanted to wait about 3 months before writing this review - I'd feel horrible if I praised it after 2 months, only to have it go bad on the third.  Anyway, unlike most happy owners who praise this as a great alternative to an iPod Nano, I'm kicking myself for ever getting buying an iPod (okay, it was a present for my wife) seeing how much better a player this is.  The Sansa isn't as slim as a Nano, but when you hit the size of a Zippo lighter, does every extra mm down really matter that much?  It's really my first mp3 player, so much of my love stems from the novelty of being able to carry around gigabytes worth of music. I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was good, and the Sansa's firmware allows you to sort through your music by song title, album, artist or genre.  (To get your song's identifying info just right, you should download a good mp3 tagging program; I've been happily using ""mp3tag"", which is available free for DL - it's simple to use and configure, but that doesn't mean that there aren't better programs available on the internet). Transferring your music is simple - your Sansa will connect to the computer using a USB port.  The Sansa uses two connection modes: MTP (which treats the Sansa like a media player to be synced) and UMS (which treats the player as an extra HD - happily enough, this mode, which I find easier to use, also allows you to use that add-on tagging software, so you get the best of both worlds).  The buttons are bit on the thin side, and you have to be careful when using the forward or reverse buttons to scan through songs lest you also skip to the next/earlier track.  You can easily scan within mp3 tracks or add songs to your ""go list"". The surprise here is the video player.  Though the screen is small, and pixelations are a fact of life on playback, the resulting images are easily watchable.  (Although it's probably optimal for character dramas and sitcoms that lack any demanding visuals; the included movie, a 30-second spot likely inspired by one of the latter ""Star Wars"" movies, was an unfortunate choice for spotlighting the Sansa's video capabilities.)  Framerate is about 15fps - it's noticeable, but it's hardly a slideshow.  Video files have to be converted before they'll play on the Sansa which...is no problem at all.  The accompanying software is simple and is finicky only against files with really long names.  Just find the files you want, click ""convert"" and the program takes care of the rest.  My commutes are now survivable thanks to the Sansa and hours of unwatched TV.  Playback can be a problem though - if you fastforward too much, the video breaks down.  Luckily, the software automatically breaks every video file down into half-hour sized chunks.  Left alone, the video played well - with only infrequent skips, and few jumps between video and audio syncing. The Sansa charges off your PC's USB port.  For those not connected 24-7, a Macally charger can be had for about [...].  However, the Sansa has good endurance - I packed one on vacation and managed to not need a charger despite watching several hours of video and listening to a fair number of mp3s.  The Sansa isn't just a great alternative to the iPod, it's a great player all around."

I decided to put a few songs he likes along with a video or two on it before I wrapped it up for him. I was expecting it to be an alright MP3 player because of the reviews I had read, but I never expected it to hold a light to any of the Apple's creations. I took it out of the box expecting to plug it in and need the program on the cd to add music to it... because that is how the other top mp3 players work. Well, it didn't need any program installations. I plugged it into my computer and it was simply drag and drop music from my music folder to the Sansa music folder. I was very impressed with this feature. I did, however, have to install the video converter program (which comes with it) to my computer in order to put videos or pictures on my comp.... BUT this was also a very simple program to use. The look of the Sansa also impressed me. Though it's a little thicker than a nano, it's still very small... and I love the blue light around the turn wheel. The video has vivid color and looks GREAT~! I'm very impressed with the FM radio and the voice recorder that it came with as well because I know my boyfriend ALWAYS likes to listen to the Kentucky basketball games and he's not always around a radio (I didn't try either out-- I'm just impressed it has them)... the iPod doesn't have a radio or voice recorder. I've owned three different music players: the 30gb Ipod Video, the 4gb first gen Ipod Nano, and *currently* the Pioneer Inno which is also an XM player. I never thought I'd say I like an MP3 player better than either of my Ipods. I never thought I'd experience one that could hold a light to either of my ipods but this one does. &for the price... I believe it may actually surpass the new Nanos (though I've not tried out a 3rd gen one). I hate for this to be a compare/contrast review... but I know what sort of reviews I was looking for whenever I was in the market to buy an MP3 player. In my opinion I think the Sansa is easier to use than the Ipod, has just as good color with the video as the iPod, runs/loads things a little faster than my iPod did, and has more features than the Ipod. I'd love to be able to compare it to the Zune (because that's another one I was considering), but I've never experienced one of those. In comparison with the Ipod... I believe this one should win-- hands down. The only negative I can see-- so far-- is it's lack of accessories on the market. We all know the Ipod has tons of items we can buy to use with it. Though I did buy an FM modulator for the Sansa... which is really the only accessory I ever use with any MP3 player (and I figure the only one my b/f will ever use). I don't know. I love this little thing and now I kinda wish I would have asked for one of these instead of a new Nano for Christmas..."
527912,A1D6VC85VOJDHV,0,1,786,B000ETVKHE,8/17/2006,5,12,12,"Best player out there, a few small quirks","This player has more storage for less price of a nano.  Its just a little thicker, but otherwise as small.  With included media converter it can play just about any type of video.  I ripped a DVD to my hard drive, compressed it to 1gb, then used the convertor software to get it on.  Now I can watch DVDs anywhere, its great.  The battery life is rediculous, sound quality is good as well.  I don't think the buttons are hard to press at all, and the scroll wheel, while mechanical, is still smooth. As stated in the title, it does have a few small quirks.  The interface does take a little practice, but after a day or 2 it was second nature.  You can add songs to the ""go list"" while its on, but to create other playlists you need to make them in windows medial player and sync the 2 devices... Its really easy, just download the pdf manual and it will make sense.  The eq has presets, but itn't otherwise adjustable.  Otherwise, the only downfall is that its not as popular as iPods, so there aren't as many accessories.  I think that if more people buy them and they become more popular accessories should start to appear, but I'll just have to wait for them."
527911,A1PN2U0AWXGVML,0,0,785,B000ETVKHE,11/29/2006,4,15,16,A terrific value for a very high tech device,"I got this the day after Thanksgiving for only $129. A terrific value for a 4 gig player. Even though I have an ipod nano and a video ipod, I wanted to get this as it has something I've been wanting for a long time - an FM player. This player is about twice as thick, a little wider and a little shorter than the nano 2G. Here's my breakdown of the sansa: PROS: Durable Shiny, hard to scratch plastic front larger screen than the ipod photo capable album art capable FM radio FM radio recorder voice recorder MP3 player Rhapsody channels (from best buy) Great battery life looks great produced by a reputable company - SANDISK CONS: tiny buttons thicker than an ipod nano screen isn't all that sharp scroll wheel can get tiring no contacts or other info can be stored FM radio doesn't have the digital info displayed such as song and name like the ZUNE does software not nearly as good or easy to use as itunes All in all a terrific value for a capable player."
527910,A2UBS8PEIP2LL3,0,0,784,B000ETVKHE,8/12/2006,5,11,11,It's a great little player,"I'll admit the main reason I did buy the Sandisk Sansa e260 was because of it's price (I bought it for $180) compared to the iPod Nano (currently the 4 GB Nano is around $250) but I also bought it because of all the added features. You can put on videos and images; you can listen to FM radio as well as record it; and more reaons that I will get to later in the review for what made me buy it. Pros: - Great battery life.. I can basically go a week without having to ever charge it. - Storage capacity has never been a problem for me and I have almost 1,000 songs and at least 20 videos. - I'm surprised no one has really mentioned this yet but you can actually expand on the total memory capacity with the microSD slot which has cards that currently go up to 2GB. (That's a total of 6GB for the e260 and 8GB for the e270.) - The sound quality is great and heck I just use the default settings that it is set at, I don't really mess around with it too much other then turning the volume up in some situations. - The video quality is great but it depends on the kind of videos you upload like I have short 5 to 7 minute videos that I download off sites and I think the quality on the player is actually better then it was on the computer in most cases. - The overall vibrancy of the screen is a sight itself. When you first turn it on you think wow the color looks great and then you get into messing around with the settings and say wow it can get even brighter. You're probably thinking about now I bet this guy has no cons at all right? Well despite my love for it there are things I don't love about it or wish would be added. Cons: - Despite the overall durability the screen does get scratched. Also finger prints show up all over but those are no problem whipping off. - Playlisting on the player is bad. I just gave up with it all together and either just have it play all the songs on shuffle or I listen to a whole albums separate. - I can't really say it's a con now since I solved the problem now but I hated the headphones, they were very uncomfortable and they just didn't fit. Funny thing is though after I took off the ear piece coverings they felt much better. I have never changed out the original headphones. - The voice recording really isn't worth it in my opinion. The sound quality isn't really that clear and you can't make very long recordings although you can make multiple recording but you're still lacking the continuation. - There aren't really any good add-on accessories for the player itself. There is a speaker dock but I really wouldn't buy it and there is also FM Car Transmitter which is great because I don't want to carry around a bunch of CDs. Other then that there is nothing. - Protective casing wise for these players the ones that are out now just look bland to put it nicely. That's one thing I liked a little about the iPod is all the different designs and stuff they have for their protective casing but there's nothing fancy about the casing for the e200 players. - I'm a guy that loves his sports talk shows and there are no stations for that on FM radio. I don't really like any of the music that they play on the radio these days other then some of the songs on good classic rock stations. Anyways my main point is I wish there was AM as well because I would definitely trade FM for AM radio. A couple tips I have learned so far: - When first turning on the player make sure you unlock it by switching the button at the top of the player left of the headphone jack. I too had been confused about this at first. - If the ear piece coverings bother you take them off. It won't be any less comfortable. - Always use the battery saving settings because they really do save you a lot of batter and you don't need to be staring the screen for every song unless you are paranoid it's going to blow up or something. - There are many easy options for uploading songs to the player so don't be afraid of not using iTunes. (Some options are Windows Media Player, Rhapsody, Napster, and more.) I hope my review has helped you some in making your decision to purchase the Sandisk Sansa e260. If I were you though I would definitely buy it because it's worth it."
527909,A1CZVKJJUWUKCE,0,1,783,B000ETVKHE,7/11/2006,4,11,11,"Better than an iPod, but still a few kinks","This MP3 player is a great buy.  Let's go through the good and the bad on this little guy. Pros: A great machine.  This MP3 player sounds very nice out of a fine pair of quality headphones, and even from those pack-in earbuds (that are surprisingly good themselves).  The screen is beautifully clear and colorful, which is great because the system allows for video playback and image viewing.  The unit feels nice in your hand or pocket and looks very stylish as well.  UI is easy to navigate, even though the buttons themselves hamper use a bit.  This player does not require itself to be synced to a computer player like the iTunes/iPod partnership, and therefore music can easily be added and removed with no DRM slowing (or stopping) the process.  Other features like FM radio and voice-recorder are nice bonus features. Cons: But it's not without quirks.  There are a few minor issues that must be dealt with.  When you drag music in via My Computer, the Sansa ignores track numbers and plays in any order; only adding music via Windows Media Player keeps tracks in order.  Player occassionally locks up during normal use, but not enough to be a bother.  Face buttons are cramped by scrollwheel and a little hard to press, and the scrollwheel itself isn't as nice as, oh, a touchwheel.  Also, the fast-forwarding is quite slow, and it can be a pain to find your place in an audiobook or podcast if stopped. Minus the quirks- most of which could be fixed by a firmware update- this is one fine machine.  If you want something like a iPod Nano, but would like to get more bang for your buck, then buy this player."
527908,A3SDCX65FWZLFI,0,0,782,B000ETVKHE,6/27/2006,4,14,15,An Excellent MP3 Player,"This MP3 player is far and away better than an iPod Nano. Like anything else, it has it's pros and cons, listed here: Pros * Excellent size and feel. It's small, yet fits in the hand perfectly. It's only slightly thicker than a Nano. * The screen is bright, crisp, and displays video. The video is a double-edged sword, however. More on that in the cons. * 4GB is a lot of space, and you can add even more with the MicroSD slot for a good price. Cons There are two different categories in the Cons. Cons that can be fixed (via a firmware update), and those that can't. First, the Cons that can be fixed: * You can only delete songs from the computer, not through the interface. This can be easily fixed in a firmware update. * Sometimes a weird glitch occurs where you see songs on the MP3 player that don't really exist. You select it and nothing happens. I find simply taking everything off the MP3 player to the computer, then back to the MP3 player will fix this. The downside to this method is that you lose the ratings you give your songs. * The movies are gigantic. The software included streamlines the process, but it manages to take a 54MB .mp4 file and convert it into a 300MB+ Motion JPEG file. I'm not sure if this is normal for the Motion JPEG codec, but it boggles the mind. Also, it breaks up videos into segments of ten minutes. I'm assuming this is because you can only fast-forward at one speed, so it helps make it easier to find where you left off. This can be fixed by simply using the same feature it uses for it's songs, the ""Scan through song"" feature. Hopefully this can be addressed in a future firmware update. Unfixable Con: * The buttons are hard to push. If the scroll wheel (which lights up with a cool blue whenever you use it) was set into the MP3 player just a liiittle bit deeper, it would be easier to hit the buttons. But it's not. So it isn't. You end up putting your thumb on the wheel, and tilting your thumb toward the button, or you use your fingernails. Sort of annoying. The menu button doesn't have a responsive ""click"" or anything of the sort, so you have to push it and hope it registers. Also sort of annoying. I know there are way more cons then pros, but it's human nature to point out the flaws. But if/when the fixable cons get fixed, it becomes obvious the pros outweigh the cons. I can still wholeheartedly recommend this MP3 player right now."

Never thought it would happen. Pro's - The sound is wonderful.  The earbuds that came with the Sansa are quite good but I am tiring of plastic in my ear so  I bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 earphones.  Great combination.  All the music I want from Yahoo for a flat fee and a player that produces wonderful sound and only slightly larger than a nano.  Good FM reception and sound. Cons - A klutsy mechanical interface. Mechanical buttons you have to press very deliberately or nothing happens.  The volume control/scroll wheel is mechanical, not touch-pad like like the ipods. All in all, it's a better way to listen to all the music you can imagine on a great sounding portable device.  You get used to the ideosyncraisies - and the price is right."

I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone had mentioned no stop button, there IS a stop button!  Also, someone had written that the picture slide show does not work, it definitely does!  Plus, I called Sandisk with some questions and they were very patient and helpful. The ONLY negative (so far) is that there are no accessories for this item but Sandisk has informed me that they are on the way.  We will have to wait and see...

I have encoded a bunch of Family Guy episodes and they play great. 3. Nice design. CONS: 1. USB only charger. This is crap. Most MP3 players do this however. You simply need to buy a 5 dollar USB to AC adapter via ebay to be able to charge on the go. MP3 player companies are retarded thinking that a person is always going to have computer access. 2. Breaks up video into small chunks. If you want to watch a 1 hour movie, it will break it up into 10 minute movies. Not a big deal but it just means you'll have like 6 files for an hour long movie. 3. Not many accessories at this time. I want to buy accessories for this puppy but since it's brand new, there's not much out there yet. Hopefully that will change."

I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently. -use MTP music files because they use less file space. -adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory. -use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra). -use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra). I do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest, and the large amount of memory the video consummes. This player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center. I think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades. The only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control. I am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon."
527903,A392TGWEPCBRPW,0,1,777,B000ETVKHE,9/17/2006,3,12,13,lasting quality? not so great.,"There are lots of great reviews already on here at Amazon, and on the web, so I'll just add what I think is important to reiterate. -The buttons they are *small*, not raised, and very close to the wheel. I have no idea why they did this. It makes it 10x harder than it should be to simply press a forward/backard button. *can* you eventually get used to it? yes. you can. but why should you have to? -LCD It was not meant to be viewed the way it's displayed! Why Sandisk? Why? If you hold the device on it's side, the lcd looks great. but if you hold it straight up, it gets washed out and kinda hurts my eyes to look at. The LCD was *obviously* meant to be put in 90' on its side, as a wide-screen lcd. why didn't they just adjust the controls to suit that? -sound quality w/the included headphones, average. If you get better headphones, very good. (for my tastes anyway, this one is so subjective, just try them out at the store for yourself) -voice recording did they actually test this? when you play back your recording, it's hissy and pops. perhaps it's the mic sensitivity? You have to speak loudly to get a ""clear"" recording of your voice, but that just seems silly to do in public.. -Crashing The latest firmware (Sept 06) fixed this mostly, but I'm not 100% sure. My sansa used to freeze/crash about once a day before, forcing me to reboot it. (hold down the power button for 15 seconds) It hasn't crashed since, but I still feel wary of it.."
527902,A3KHNBVJXSTALN,0,0,776,B000ETVKHE,7/6/2007,1,15,17,"Nice features, terrible design - not recommended","I bought this gadget in Nov 2006 as an alternative to the Nano.  I wanted something small and also something that would work with Napster's On-the-go feature, which is not compatible with the iPod.  Had it not been for this particular requirement I actually would have bought the iPod without hesitation. So, to be straight, I haven't liked this thing almost from the moment I purchased it.  Partly due to design, partly due to reliability issues: 1.  Button design.  The buttons around the wheel are very hard to press b/c they're depressed below the surface of the wheel, unless you jab it with your nail's end. If I want to rewind or fast-foward, my finger won't catch the button properly, even though it feels like it did, and when I release the button the track just skips to the beginning or end instead of rewinding/fast-forwarding... ANNOYING. 2.  Quality.  In the last month, the center function button has been giving me problems and doesn't always respond to my press, as though it's sort of stuck.  Poor mechanical design.  I haven't dropped it or poured water on it... this is a result of simply having used it normally.  If the button stops working, this thing will become totally useless... KILLER. 3.  Record button design.  I never use the record feature, and who does??  But the HUGE button is prominently located on the upper left side, right where it's comfortable to hold your index and ring fingers as you curl them under the device.  Particularly when I jog with it, my finger frequently accidentally hits this button and it STOPS playing the track and starts recording, which is ridiculous, but the worst part is... 4.  Record feature bug.  ... recently, after I accidentally hit the record button, it won't STOP recording!  I press all the buttons to try to make it stop and even try to shut it off, and nothing happens.  It just keeps recording until all available space is used up, making it totally unusable for minutes at a time.  KILLER. 5.  Dumb subscription synch feature.  If you haven't synched it in a couple weeks and you use Napster On The Go, the licences will not have been renewed so you are asked to sync it again to update the licences - FINE, this is normal.  But if I play an album that happens to need renewing, it will cycle through EVERY song and spend seconds on each one, flashing me a message to re-synch.  OKAY, I GET IT.  It won't let me cancel out of this annoying cycle until it's done going through every song in the album.  18 tracks on an album that aren't updated, and man, there's a 2 minutes of my time spent staring at my MP3 player wishing it would just stop.  And the power button won't kill it.  KILLER. 6.  Power button does too much but not what I want it to do.  The power button is a multi-function button that takes you to various menus.  But the bloody thing doesn't really do well what it should:  turn the unit OFF promptly.  It doesn't interrupt certain functions (read above) and seems to be a bit picky, esp b/c you have to hold it down for several seconds to get it to shut off.  If you don't hold it down quite long enough and get impatient, you'll be taken to various menus instead of getting it to shut down.  Not killer, but STUPID. So, in sum, the design and reliability of this thing have been sub-par by any standard.  Although it plays music with nice audio quality, if I get annoyed with it every other time I use it and it prevents me from playing music, even for just a minute, it's garbage b/c it's not fulfilling its mission as a music player. On the plus side, the audio is quite nice - although the audio on the iPod is better, as the equalization is simply better.  The video feature is really awesome.  the screen is nice and bright, and synching video with the included converter is pretty easy.  Photos display well, too.  The recorder, I presume, works well but I never use it. I suppose it could be handy if you're looking for that feature. My conclusion is that this is a nice unit with good features and good ideas that make it a good contender to the iPod.  But with so many little, simple flaws that inhibit my easily using it, which drive me crazy, and bigger reliability issues with buttons, I wouldn't go near it despite the attractive feature set."
527901,A1ZS8LRP35GNTW,0,1,775,B000ETVKHE,5/19/2007,4,8,8,This is the DMP I've been looking for!,"I've been through TONS of MP3 players and I've got to say that unless something drastic happens, I've found the player I've always wanted.  That's not to say it's perfect and I'll get into the cons a little later, but it's pretty much exactly what I've been looking for. Simply put the Sansa is awesome. Everything about the player is just ""cool."" The screen is Bright and vivid, if a bit small.  You can see what's playing, adjust settings, volume, view playlists and just about everything else on the brightest sunny day. Sound is excellent for a flash-based player and includes several preset EQ settings as well as a custom EQ. Playing music is a breeze.  Just select the music icon on the screen and from there you can play your own, pre-edited playlists, play music based on your ratings of tunes.  Play all songs in a particular style or genre, or just choose an artist or album to listen to. Once you're playing music, the Sansa will display album art if you've got an actual picture file associated with the artist or album, otherwise the screen is just a simple progress bar with the artists name, album name and track name listed on the screen.  The menus can be a bit difficult to get into as you sometimes need to hit the power/menu button to back up or escape to a sub menu. Once you're jamming, there is nothing more annoying than having one of the buttons accidentally activated by a wrong move or accidental button press, especially if you listen to long podcasts or long mp3 tracks.  Well, Sansa's got ya covered.  There is a sliding ""lock"" switch on the player that locks the buttons so you can't skip to the next track accidentally or throw the volume into the extreme level by bumping into something. The player includes an FM tuner, but it's fairly weak as there is no extendable antenna, but it will work for powerful or local stations. There is a voice recorder, FM tuner recorder, video player and photo player. The photo player seems a bit useless because of the size of the screen but it might be a nice thing to occasionally show someone some digital pictures you've taken and stored away on your mp3 player...  Then again, maybe not. The Video player is a great addition, but again it is limited by the size of the screen the player has.  It does an admirable job of displaying your movies, tv shows, ect that you upload to the device via the media conversion software included in the device, that is if you can get it to work correctly.  The software also can bloat your videos, especially if you are converting AVI files or Divx files...  It's still a great addition that give the Sansa a bit of an edge over the Ipod Nano which Sandisk is hoping to compete with. Now there are a few issues. The firmware on my player was old when I opened the box and as per sandisks' instructions I connected to the web, downloaded the firmware update software and launched the update on my device.  Within a few hours my player was stopping and shutting down every so many minutes while playing tunes and eventually the Main Image of the device failed. This was resolved in less than an hour by contacting Sandisk and getting the original firmware back. Be advised that things CAN go wrong with the newer firmware version.  Update at your own risk.  I'll try it again in the future to see if it was just a bad upgrade or if there was some kind of error between my computer and the player when last I updated the firmware. Also, the wheel that you use to navigate the menus and adjust the volume with just feels odd.  If you open the case you'll see that it's basically just a gear that drives a switch, but it's kinda iffy at times.  the button placement as a little too close to the scroll wheel, so if you have medium or large fingers it can be hard to hit the play/pause, forward, back and menu buttons. Finally, there is no Audible Audio support, so if you have any Audible Audio books, you cannot listen to them on this player.  When I connected to Audible to attempt to download my library of audio books to the device, Audible's Download Manager told me that the E200 series players are not compatible with Audible without a Firmware update.  Well, that update didn't let me listen to audible books and cause other errors that ended up with the device crashing. If not for the firmware issue I had and the button placement, this would be a full on 5 star product.  As it stands now, this is the best MP3 player I've ever owned, even if I have to keep my small RCA ""Thumb drive"" player for listening to my audio books..."
527900,AQS8GWGTESRFI,0,0,774,B000ETVKHE,12/25/2006,5,8,8,Amazing MP3 player,"I absolutely love this mp3 player. I bring it with me everywhere! It is not only cheaper than an iPod, but it has better features. I'm mostly just interested in playing music all day, but having some videos to watch on this player is a lovely bonus. The Sansa Media Converter (which comes with the product) will convert supported video files to a specific file type for the mp3 player. The only thing is, once the files are converted, the file size is still the same or slightly bigger (which I find odd, since I thought they are supposed to be smaller in dimension). The time it takes to convert isn't long either--a few minutes for a video file nearly 200 MB on the computer. The videos on the mp3 player are crispy clear too. Physically, the Sansa is a small, attractive-looking device. It's lightweight and has an anti-scratch back. The wheel does feel ""cheap,"" but does that really affect anything? The buttons are feel fine and work too; I don't understand the complaints about them. I accidentally dropped this the day I received it (whoops), but nothing happened. I haven't dropped it since, so I'm not sure how durable it is (feels as if it is, though). The package also comes with a velvet case, earphones, and software. I do wish it is possible to use the mp3 player with the case on, but maybe there will be better accessories in the future. In the mean time, avoid using the earphones the package comes with--you will hear better audio quality with different ones. Like the package says, simply drag and drop files from your computer into the mp3 player's folder (plug the player into your computer via USB to open the folder). No iTunes or extra software needed to transfer these files. This handy dandy Sansa is not only a music and video player, but it also stores pictures for slideshows, has an FM radio, and is also a voice recorder. I don't think there are any other products out in the market with the same features..."
527899,A1VASOVPUGUYEJ,0,1,773,B000ETVKHE,6/9/2007,3,11,12,Not so great for podcasts or audiobooks,"I've only been trying to find my way around this player for two days now, but am having some frustrations. My main pleasure in using an mp3 player is listening to audio books and podcasts. My 1GB Creative MuVo was filling up too easily, so I ordered this 4GB Sansa both for the extra space and the screen, which seemed to be easier to view what was on the player.  It is a very nice looking and feeling player, but I have to say it's not that great for my purposes.  As has been said, waaay to easy to lose your place when listening to a book, and unless I just haven't discovered it yet, there's no way to fast forward or reverse within the part you're listening to.  It's either all the way back to the prior section, or all the way forward to the beginning of the next.  (Edit - I did find out how to ff and rew - you just have to continue holding the button down rather than just ""clicking"" on it. If you click, it goes to the beginning or end, but if you hold it down you can go forward or backward as much as you want) I've also loaded one downloaded podcast onto it via drag/drop; when it's hooked up to the computer I can see the podcast, but can't for the life of me find it when the player is not hooked to the computer.  It is compatible with the downloaded audio books from Overdrive, but not Audible.com.  (Edit again - I found that if I was careful to turn the player ON before connecting to the USB cable, once I loaded the podcast the player recognized it. Also, if you can get your audible.com books converted to mp3 they are useable on the player. There are several ways to do this, some more time consuming than others but it can be done.) Documentation is very sketchy, and it's mostly a trial and error method of finding your way around.  I've successfully unloaded the music that came preloaded by deleting within Windows Explorer.  I'll learn my way around, and live with this, but if you're looking for reasons similar to mine, I can highly recommend the Creative MuVo players for ease of use, and am glad I still have mine.  Maybe 1GB isn't so bad after all. (Edit 3 - there is a very good user's forum at anythingbutipod.com, and you can find lots of answers there.  Bottom line, I think the learning curve for this is more if you want to use it like I do for books & podcasts than if you want to listen to music.)"

Plugged it into my laptop and could get it to register maybe 1 out of 10 times. I called their customer support and the guy wouldn't even give me the time of day, instead he emailed me useless information. I returned the product that day. Then I buy the Sansa e260 and guess what??? Same problem. After two frustrating days I realized their customer support WAS open on weekends so I called. The fellow was helpful and said my USB ports might not be generating enough power to run the device properly because I was using a laptop. Well, I unplugged my other USB devices and what do you know??? It works fine! OK, so I can't use my optical mouse and a couple other things while I'm synching music, but whatever. The player works, it looks cool and my problem was solved. If only the Creative support people had suggested something similar I bet that device would have worked just fine, also!!!"

This player has great features for its price like: Micro SD expansion slot (Up to 2GB of additional memory), FM tuner, recording voice or FM radio, 5 band customizable equalizer, photos, video, drag and drop available, User replaceable battery (unlike the ipod that you have to send back to get the battery replaced)etc. I use it mostly for music and what I would like to share is my experience uploading music from WinAmp. -CD's of house music or similar genres are mixed and you would like to hear the songs in order and without any skips between songs. To do this, create a playlist in Winamp with the songs in the order that you want them. -When you connect the Sandisk e200 series Winamp will recognize it and show it in the ""portables"" section of the media library. -Right click the name of the playlist, in the options select ""Send to"", it should be a ""Sansa e260"" option (e2xx depending on your model) -Be sure to do this in MTP  (Media Transfer Protocol) mode, otherwise the playlist will end in the root directory of your player instead of the music folder. - When playing, instead of looking for the first song, look for the playlist name in music menu of your Sansa e200. You can have multiple Play-lists in the player (don't know if there is a limit). You can also transfer individual songs from Winamp by right-clicking on the song and following the same ""send to"" procedure. And you can still play ALL your music in shuffle mode from the music menu of the player if you get bored with the order of the playlists. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the player and its compatibility with Winamp. On top of the usual Media player, rhapsody. And not having to use iTunes makes me REALLY HAPPY!"

When I asked them why they wanted a Nano, it had NOTHING to do with features, performance or value.  I want a pink one!  All my friends have Nanos!  They look cool! When we actually went to a local store to physically compare the Nano and Sansa side by side, and I explained the Nano had an FM tuner, could play videos, had a voice recorder, bigger screen and was less money, they were sold.  My daughter now tells me her friends with Nanos are now jealous of her Sansa.  She loves being able to play music videos, not only music.  Sure the screen is tiny, but it is workable. I try to teach my children about making intelligent choices, and not simply following the crowd.  The Nano is a good player, the Sansa is also a good player, but has more features and is a better value.  If you want function and value, the Sansa has the Nano beat hands down. Oh, I almost forgot.  Both units are working perfectly.  Good sound, easy to navigate, no issues uploading media (audio and video), id3 tags work perfectly, good FM reception.  My kids even use the voice recorder to practice presentations they have to do in school.  Very happy with the Sansa."

It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two. The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.) There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!

It had excellent sound quality, the capacity seemed to be more than ample, the FM tuner worked like a dream,and the controls were extremely easy to master. The only issue I had with the player for the first few months was that the screen would occasionally ""ghost.""  I did discover that this could easily be fixed by buying a special screw driver and removing, then reinserting, the battery. Roughly six months later, however, the player became full and it took it fifteen minutes to load every time I turned the play off or on.  I figured that this was not a big deal as I could easily buy a micro sd card for the expansion slot.  Consulting the Sandisk website, I learned that any card should work--this was completely incorrect.  After two weeks of my computer and the player not recognizing the new card, as well as numerous calls to customer service, my father realized that only 4 gig and less cards would work in the slot.  I got a new card, and was finally able to use the player again.  Due to a flaw in the firmware, however, I am unable to delete any songs from the player, though I've tried every ""solution"" the Sandisk customer service page recommended. Now, the death of my Sansa has finally come--the wheel has become inoperable.  I am unable to make any selections from the menu, choose songs or albums, or even control the player's volume.  Even the slightest movement of the play sends the wheel moving through two or three rotations. In short, I would gladly have kept my old Creative USB MP3 player had I known how terrible this player is."

The Macally AC charger it's a great adition to the player and the travel kit it's also a must have. There're many people complaining about a problem that the player has about recognazing some ID3 tags and showing files as ""unknow"" artists and albums. What has worked for me is (re)tagging the files that apear as unknow with a program like Cowbell Music organizer (it's free). if the file it's on the sansa already you have to delete, after tagging the files, the PP5000.dat file located on System/Data on your sansa (in MSC mode) in order to recreate the database after restarting. If after that your still have a problem convert your file to 128kbps (I use Soundconverter, also free) it has worked for me on those rare ocations. And another problem I had once was a file apearing as ""bad file"" on the screen, and it was because the name of the file started with a space, after removing it (renaming the file), it was OK. Let me tell you, the sansa show your files according to the ID3 information, not the folder name or the file name, so your files must been tagged in order to apear with the correct information. It's not a common problem for me, but it's good to know how to fix it if it happens. that should make your everyday use of the sansa a lot more pleasing."

I being one of the geeky parents knew the Sansa was a much better deal with the fm radio and the video. I got 4 gb for the price of a 2 gb Nano as well. I love the ability to drag and drop music onto the Sansa. I'm not a big fan of syncing since I have way too much music on my pc to sync. The video conversion worked great as well with the included software. The picture is small(I prefer my psp for movies and videos) but looks very sharp. Let us not forget the ability to change the battery yourself. A big factor in my book. I'm sure she will pwn all the nano kids. Be a leader not a follower. Go with the better product not the hype and trendy.

It works extremely well with the Yahoo Music subscription whereas others in the past have had many software issues. the memory expansion slot is a plus but with 4 gigs, you can get a load of songs on it anyway. the only thing i can find wrong is that it does not work well with Yahoo Music playlists. Extra steps are required to copy them over which isn't worth the time. But the extremely long battery life is worth the lack of playlist functionality."

Found that the Sansa products work with virtually with all music venues for download, rather than being locked into the Itunes venue as is true with Ipod. This product is easy to use, ultimate sound, great FM reception, and just looks snazzy (I know an old school term). I'm extremely satisfied with this product.

Pressing the menu key simply caused the blue switch to light up and stay lit, no screen display, no sound, and the menu key wouldn't turn off the blue light. I googled around a bit looking for hints/tips on fixing the problem and saw a suggestion to remove the battery to completely reset the device. Being daring, I unscrewed the four tiny phillips head screws on the back of the unit, removed the battery for around 30 seconds, put it all back together, and voila. The e260 came alive and seems to be functioning normally. Hope the above helps some other poor soul suffering from what seems to be a DOA unit. As for the e260, I love it.

I have no worries about breaking it (unlike the nano), but I don't feel burdened carrying it around (sometimes I forget it is in my pocket). Holds plenty of music and it is easy to sync with my computer. I love the radio option and the ability to record.

527878,A1BUXEL8E9ORT3,0,0,752,B000ETVKHE,7/11/2007,5,5,5,"Sansa - a great mp3 player, excellent value","I've owned the 4gb version for nearly 1-year now and I love it!  The fact that this does not use ""touch buttons"" (like ipod and creative's devices) is a huge advantage in my mind. That means you do not have to press the hold button every time you place the player in your pocket and again when you want to change something. Not being forced to use itunes or any other music software is also a key factor for me. I've never used the video feature as I have no desire to watch video on a 2"" screen.  In my opinion, Sandisk's Sansa is the only other real competitor in the flash memory mp3 space.  Hey Mr. Softy - why not just buy SNDK (only $12B) and stop throwing away $$$ on your very poor internal attempts? Positives: * Works extremely well with Media Player 10 - simply click and drag. But you don't have to use any particular software, no need to feel stuck with MP or itunes. * Actual buttons - no touch wheels.  You do not have to use the ""hold"" button when it is in your pocket. * Solid music organization software. Sandisk constantly provides updates which you are alerted to when you connect to your computer. * FM player * Great battery life (also battery is replaceable, I bought a cheap back-up just in case) * Relatively cheap * SD micro memory expansion * Not an ipod! I personally hate having the same thing as everyone else, plus apple has always annoyed me with their proprietary/closed systems * Nice and small, but yet not fragile feeling. The metal backside gives it a solid feel (I've dropped mine numerous occasions with no issues). Negatives: * You need to remove 4 small screws to get to the battery.  I have had my Sansa freeze up maybe 7-10 times over the past 10 months.  To reset the player, you need to remove the battery, so it can be a bit annoying to have to use a small screw driver (would be better if you could access the battery as easy as on a cell phone). But given the infrequency of this issue, it has not proved to be the end of the world. * I really don't like the record button on the side.  This gets accidentally pressed somewhat often (maybe 2-3 time a month), which can be annoying.  If I could, I would disable this button.  Who wants to record the radio or a conversation with their mp3 player anyway? Maybe some people do, but I personally will never ever (intentionally) use this feature. * Not a ton of add-on products.  This seems to be gradually changing, but I have not seen a nice car player built specifically for the Sansa.  Not a big deal for me, since I find an old school tape player adapter to sound way better than generic FM transmitters in my car (which has a high end Bose stock system) and I have bought a really cheap AC charger from a 3rd party."

That said I have had some issues. The main issue is the playlist function.  It has been mentioned before but needs to reiterated again.  There is one playlist with a less then user friendly way of building it.  Seems to me this is something they could improve with a firmware update and if they do I would give it 5 stars instead of 4. SanDisk you are really missing the boat with this feature.  One of the things that makes MP3 players so fun is the ability to create multiple playlist that you can just select, depending on mood, situation, etc, and then just let it run.  With just one basic playlist you can create a a list of something like your present day favorites but even then you don't want to listen to these songs over and over.  Variety is the key. The mechanical thumbwheel is IMHO easier to use then the Ipod style but at the same time I do worry about the ruggedness of this feature.  The select buttons are trickier to use then the Ipod but it's not that bad. Fix the playlist issue and SanDisk has the best player on the market."

I tried the memory expansion card but couldn't use it the same way as the built in memory, which is typical for mp3 players, so I gave the first one to my wife and got the e260 4gb model. This is a sleek little player, not as thin as some but on the other hand it seems very solid with a rigid metal back, and not very likely to break very easily. I acually like the thumbwheel, and find it easy to use. It would be helpful to be able to delete files directly from the Sansa but perhaps this feature will be added in a future firmware update. Mine came with a 30 day free subscription to Rhaspody, which allows you unlimited downloads to the Sansa, and there's a ton of music of all types available on their site. I also got the FM transmitter so it can be played on FM stereos without mp3 capability, and the sound is suprisingly good, even on stock FM automobile radios.

The navigation is somewhat odd. Although my music are organized in folders, once they are copied to the e260, the folders are no more visible. The player lets you play all songs, by artist, albums, genre, playlists, etc. This is completely different from the SDMX1 in which you navigate by folders.

It was worth it $$. I am reading these cons about this device and please tell me what MP3 player is perfect. I read pros and cons about every MP3 on the market and none of them has gotten a perfect score. Yes it has frozen up when I held the power button too long. But I learned not to hold it for 10-15 seconds. It dont' take much to power on. Is the screen small, yes but when I was waiting in the doctor's office, the Usher video was great to watch and listen to. I also downloaded a Martial Art movie and just to kill some time, it serves it purpose. I purchased a arm band for this device from Best Buy and it was design specifically for this device. So accessories are available from Best Buy, Circuit City, and on Amazon. So if you are looking for the perfect MP3 Player, give it up, you will never find it. However, if you are looking for something that sounds great, perfect size, and has lots of cool extra's, this Sansa e260 is the one for you. You will not go wrong with this one. By the way, Sandisk tech support and customer service is great. They replaced my daughter's m200 with no problems and it is now playing great."

After using one for two days and experiencing the ""freezing"" problems experienced by over 100 of the other reviewers, I decided to send back both for a full refund. This was the first time I ever had to return an item to Amazon for any reason and even though one package was opened they still gave me a full refund for both due to the noted defect. Thank goodness for their great return policy. I tried to give this product a chance since so many mp3 players seem to have firmware issues but I didn't want to chance the problem staying or getting worse after the 30 day return timeframe. I'm glad I made that decision and am going to try the Samsung K3 or K5 instead, since those models seems to be more stable."
527867,A1C4Y36W500X9L,0,1,741,B000ETVKHE,11/7/2006,5,7,8,Good job Sandisk,"First, I have to admit that I was never a fan the Ipod.  Too proprietary for my taste and the Ipod crowd tends to be a pack of pretentious followers.  I have seldom been as happy with an electronics purchase as I have been with this little MP3 Player.  I have not needed to utilize product support for this item, so I have no valid comments to share in that department.  Functionality of this device is great, the menus are fairly intuitive and the overall capabilities are outstanding.  There are many more devices marketed to compete with this one which fall way short.  I use mine for everything from working out (outside in the elements) to reading and ebooks and have stored some of my college lectures on it(video).  It has not failed me yet and the battery life fantastic.  The software that comes with this device is somewhat useful; although, I have found that my favorite feature is how easy it is to drag and drop my mp3's and WMA files into the device window while paired with my computers.  That's right, I said computers.  2,3, a dozen, it doesnt matter with the Sansa; unlike MANY other MP3 players that don't like to share themselves(this should be especially important for you student and office types).  It has paired with every XP machine I have plugged it into.  What I do not like about the product is that accessories (and I didn't buy the thing for a bunch of accessories) have been slow to catch on; however, they are finally cropping up.  This is my experience with the Sansa e260, which I have owned for over 6 months and counting.  I was somewhat reluctant to purchase this due to apprehension of its smaller memory capacity but I have more than adequate memory for practical use.  I rip fairly high bitrate files (at least 192) and have a ton of files onboard.  I have yet to utilize the Micro SD slot.  The volume control, IMO, is easy to confidently use blind.  It does not require you to focus strictly on the controls when adjusting volume or thumbing through songs (ie. while driving or working out).  I hope this helps you decide on your purchase."

Not only is it really cool looking, with the blue click-button, but the color screen is also a plus.  The photo and video is fantastic!  There is absolutely no comparison to the iPod nano, this is way better!  The radio gets great frequency strength and the handy dandy record-from-radio option is very convenient.  When putting music on the player, just click and drag or you can use Windows Media Player (like I do) and it automatically puts your songs in alphabetical order, by artists/album/song.  I really can't think of any cons to this excellent player, so I would reccommend getting it here at Amazon or at any Circuit City store when they have a sale. ($200)"

Sandisk dropped the ball on this one. There are many good things to say about this product, but at its price, you would expect a product to compete with the others on the market. virtually without documentation, assumes that you are an expert in the arcane uses of Microsoft Windows Media Player e.g., the documentation implies no way to build playlists, but you can through WMP, not to obviously though, plan to spend a few hours learning how to use it.  then use it regularly, as otherwise you'll forget how to use a non-intuitive pgm. No bookmarks.  forget using it to play podcasts or audiobooks (also no support for audiobook format) - this is a major flaw for me.  Customer service says that it is not intended for playing podcasts or audiobooks.  period... Communication is poor.  Suggestions to customer service go nowhere.  They say they have no way to supply feedback.  The sandisk website has no option for customer feedback.  direct email comes back saying you don't have permission to mail to us. Automatic update: installs a program on your computer that runs full time (and is a service so it's tough to kill) but doesn't really update until you switch modes on the mp3 player manually, then the screen fills with misleading information to add confusion. i.e., not automatic, but deliberate, but bogs down you pc full time anyway. Overall it could come very close to being an ipod killer, but they didn't go the extra step, and threw it onto the market prematurely without plans to bring it up to code. So let's face it, sandisk is a hardware company, nothing else. The radio is none too good.  instead of using the earphone cord as antenna, it uses the usb connect to the laptop cord as a pigtail  i.e., useless. there's much more to say, and I'll add to this as I get time. You can buy mine cheaply on ebay, as I am going to buy a different mp3 player (any suggestions?)"

For me the slightly larger physical size is an advantage. plus some accessories that are available for this player aren't available with ipods or zunes. I like the fact that you can upgrade the player online and it has an easily replaceable battery. The cost of the battery is very reasonable. The playing time on the battery is phenomenal- mine has been averaging about 22 to 24 hours on a single charge. We have 5 e series players in our household now. We all agree that for the money, it is the best player on the market. There are lots of places to improve- a better EQ, louder standard sound, and for the size- a speaker phone, a couple more menus, just to name a few. But overall we're very, very satisfied with our purchases. Oh yeah, I almost forgot the sd expansion slot so you can improve the size of storage capacity. All software needed is provided too."

It's small enough to keep in my purse and tough enough to survive morning runs. If you're looking for an MP3 player that does the job without spending a small fortune, this is a great choice. It's easy to use, easy to charge, has a long battery life, and is tough enough to survive the occasional crash to the floor. I love the understated look and appreciate being able to add MP3s of various fomats. It's just what you need out of an MP3 player; nothing more, nothing less."

This is a free service in my state and there are many books to choose from, organized into categories for easy browsing.  I am not a hi-tech person but have been able to download the books and transfer them to my PD pretty efficiently.  The player is very easy to use and the quality is excellent.  The lock switch enables me to put it in my pocket while listening and not risk hitting another function accidentally.  The 4G size enables me to put several audiobooks on the player at once.  The only downside I've found is that once I start listening to a book, I have to finish it or will lose my place and must tediously fastforward through hours of listening to get back to it.  I have e-mailed tech support to see if there's a quicker way to return to a listening spot, but haven't gotten a clear response from them.  I have also purchased a small case for strapping the player to my arm while walking, a cable for playing through the speakers on my computer, and a car converter for playing through the cassette in my car.  The total spent was $25, and has provided a lot of convenient listening options."

I've used it in my car, at the gym (where I listen to the TVs broadcasted over an FM xmitter), and in class where I record lectures. It works well in all situations. I synched it up to Windows Media Player 11 and built playlists there. I've also briefly experimented with the video, but I don't have a big need for that now. Files converted over easily enough with the software that came on the CD. The battery lasts a long time. I'm able to listen to it on a 1.5 hr commute and then record 8 hrs of class and I still have plenty of juice to spare. Sound quality seems fine for me. I'm no audiophile.

The FM Radio isn't exactly what you'd call ""high quality,"" and the recorder's not much better, but they work and you can easily crank the volume up if they sound faint.

I was determined not to spend the big $$'s on a player that would not stand the test of time.  I purchased a previous generation of Sansa 1GB player, and loved it.  But it lacked the bells and whistles that I enjoy.  Due to my previous experience with the Sansa line, I decided on the 4 GB e260.  I have owned it for about two months, and haven't been happier! GOOD: -Most importantly - great sound!  A huge improvement over my last Sansa, and the iPod mini. -Small!  I carry it around in my purse all of the time. -Radio option is nice to have, with great reception. -Very solid and sleek.  Seems durable. -Easy to use - just drag and drop.  I don't even bother with Media Player. -My main complaint with the old Sansa is that it would loose its place in a track when powered off.  So long podcasts would start over when powered back on.  Now my new e260 player holds its place - I'm so glad I upgraded! GOOD and BAD: -Expandable memory slot is nice.  But it is micro-SD.  I have a ton of SD cards, but no micro-SD -Battery lasts forever - more than 10 hours.  But when it dies, you have to hook it up to a computer to charge.  I miss the old Sansa where I could remove a re-chargable battery, put a fresh one in and keep going. -Tiny!  Which means tiny buttons and a tiny screen.  I would not recommend buying this player for video purposes.  It looks great for such a tiny screen, but it is tiny! -I am not a technical person, so I had a heck of a time figuring out how to convert a video.  I thought I could just use the Sansa converter and go.  But no, I have to de-crypt it, then use the Sansa converter.  It was hard for a person like myself to figure it out.  But I do have to say, the Sansa converter does shrink the files down nicely!  I have put both pictures and video on my player without problems. BAD: -The fast-forward and rewind button proceeds slowly!  I listen to long podcasts, and it can take a while to move to where I want in the track.  If you want to move forward 2 hours, you can pretty much forget about it since the buttons are so small and hard to hold down for that long. -That's it! I'm so happy with my purchase.  It is ""cheap"" in price, yet has everything I could ask for.  Thanks Sansa!"

The look is sleek and stylish and the buttons are easy to use and it works great! I am not technically savy, but this player is pretty much self-explainatory.  The instructions that come with the player are sparse, but all you have to do is sit down and ""play"" with it for about 15 min and you've pretty much gotten it figured out.  The hardest part is figuring out which USB mode does what. I've been using Windows Media Player to sync my songs to the player.  It is easy, easy, easy and works without a hitch.  Even downloads and saves your playlists.  When you want to delete something, just switch the USB mode and go under My Computer and delete them out like you would any other file or folder. Probably the only thing I didn't like about this player were the speakers that came with it.  They sound fine, but they hurt my ears, just not comfortable at all.  But that's an easy fix, just buy a pair of the gel earbuds. I also bought a $6.00 audio cable by Belkin and was pleased to find that the Sansa player plugs right into my stereo. I would highly recommend this player for anyone, even if (like me) you're not technically inclined.  Also, just FYI, Amazon had the best price I could find on the 4G player - even beating out stores like Walmart. Hints: 1. print out the PDF instruction booklet contained on the setup CD.  It will help to explain about the different USB modes. 2. don't forget to go to sandisk website and download the firmware updater."

There are few problems with the device itself (tracks not appearing or erasing occasionally).  Most of the problems come from a conflict with Windows OS and my subscription service (Rhapsody).  To solve problems make sure to update your Windows media player and windows security components.  Also remember to turn your player to MSC usb mode occasionally.  The update program from Sandisk only work on MSC.  Just thought I'd share for those who seem to have problems with this product.

I do heartly recommend that you get the silicone case with arm strap and belt clip AND an AC adapter for it. the buttons can be a bit hard to navigate at times and then are things that are a bit annoying at times, but I'll still give FIVE thumbs up!

The interface was somewhat intuitive, if not cumbersome. Initially I had connected it to USB 1.1.  Nowhere does it say that it will not work with 1.1, but evidently that is so.  The non-intuitive PC application hung or crashed.  I ultimately changed to using USB 2.0, and the hanging stopped. The device's interface employs several layers of menus for anything you want to to - which is cumbersome for a device that should ""just work"" without a lot of interaction.  All the video files that ""successfully"" transferred, failed to actually play.  Half the mp3's would not play, instead reporting an error.  The same files play just fine on a PC's mp3 player.  A few of the unplayable files could not be removed, due to a bug in the device's UI - so presumably I'd have to re-initialize everything to free up the space taken by those files. Although this product may be slightly cheaper than higher-end media players such as the iPod, you need to be prepared to work with non-production-quality software. I ultimately had to return the product after just a day or two of trying to get it to work properly."

The built-in microphone allows the Sansa to act as a voice recorder; I have not used this feature yet.  It is also possible, of course, to store animations, movies, and images on the Sansa. The sansa comes with re-charging and data-transfer cable, lanyard, and soft storage bag.  The lanyard is large enough that I can hang the Sansa around my neck.  The Sansa is heavy for its size - a feature that I like; the weight reminds me that I am carrying it and helps prevent loss.

My main reason for using an MP3 player is to listen to audiobooks-mostly downloaded from our local library's e-library site.  The site is not compatible with iPods, so that was not a consideration-not to mention I've never liked iTunes. After reading the reviews of this player and a few others, I purchased it on sale for $[...] off.  The first thing that I did before transfering anything to the player was to go to the Sandisk website and download the update that has been mentioned in a couple of other reviews.  To date i have not had any problems with the machine freezing up, etc. The player comes with Rhapsody software.  It is fairly simple to use once you get used to it.  I had a few problems at first and found the tech support people at both Rhapsody and Sandisk to be very helpful and they replyed to my emails quickly.  The player itself is very easy to use, small and light.  I have no problem resuming an audiobook when turning the player back-it automatically restarts at the same place in a file that you left off. The only real downside is that this particular player is not compatible with [...] files. Some of the older Sandisk players are, but not this one.

527845,AUYBC6VC7TPDX,0,1,719,B000ETVKHE,2/28/2007,5,4,4,Excellent MP3 Player,"This mp3 player performs exactly as it says it will. We bought three; one for me, one for my lady, and one as a present for a friend, because we thought so highly of the earlier ones we bought. These purchases were after several other brands that were very disappointing. I've been using it for about two months now, with no problems. It's everything I could want in an mp3 player, plus the FM radio receiver, which works very well. The battery is easily replaceable (unlike the iPod), although I haven't had any reason to do that yet. Songs are easy to download with a drag-and-drop facility from your computer's HD. Your can also sync to WPM playlists. It charges the battery by simply plugging in the USB connector to a USB port on your computer, and the battery runs for several hours on a single charge. Sound quality is good. You can also store images and videos, if you want to eat up the memory space with that kind of thing. I'll admit to loading on a video of G.W. Bush bloopers for entertaining my politically-aware friends. MY ADVICE: Avoid iRiver players. We bought one and it promptly failed. A Google search revealed a lot of other people who experienced the same kind of problems: the OS fails and is usually impossible to get working again. We also bought a generic Chinese player. It kind of works, although the user's manual is such bad Chin-lish that we show it to people to get a guaranteed half hour of uncontrollable laughter. Beyond the humor value, the manual is utterly unintelligible; there's no way of learning how the thing works! Also, unless you're an absolute diehard Apple fanatic, stay away from the popular iPod. It's much too expensive, very proprietary (Apple has a long history of shooting themselves in the foot with this approach), and there are battery problems (again, a Google search will fill you in on the details of this problem). If all you want is an mp3 player that has all the latest features and works exactly as advertised, you can't go wrong with the Sansa player. I suspect there are other players out there that also perform well. There's certainly an overwhelming assortment of them. But, if you want to be sure you get your money's worth without doing extensive research, you won't go wrong with the Sansa."

He loves it, has plenty of space, ergonomically fine, good screen, good sound... what else could you want?  We subscribed to Rhapsody and intend to keep it.  I'd recommend it to all those who don't want to be a drone in lock-step to the Apple hype."

It is true that the buttons may be difficult to press for people with large fingers, but I think that most peoples problems are user errors.  People complained about having to press buttons twice, but that is because the first press bring the unit out of sleep mode.  Just takes a little getting used to, but it works well. As for the one negative that I have found, I still cannot design my own playlists besides the ""GO list"" designed on the system.  Songs must be added to the list individually to the list.

527842,A1OARU91GUZKHE,0,0,716,B000ETVKHE,2/13/2007,5,4,4,Made the right choice,"I did a lot of research before purchasing my first MP3 player. Fairly computer savvy but a novice to MP3 players. Was close to purchasing the Zen but was concerned about how many people said they froze up. Fortunately I looked a little longer and discovered the Sansa e260. Great reviews though some mentioned them freezing up. Seeing that seemed an inherent problem with MP3 players, I knew I'd just have to take my chances. Finally went to the store and actually saw and held both the Zen and Sansa. After examining them both the choice was simple. The Zen felt cheap and not very durable. I liked the weight of the Sansa and the size of the screen. Didn't know if I'd really need 4 GB but figured if I was going to get one I might as well get one with a lot of storage with the ability to add expansion. All that said, I have had the Sansa for about two weeks and while I have not had the time to REALLY explore all of its features, I can say that so far I am EXTREMELY pleased with it. Downloading music from my computer was cake. It is holding its first charge exceptionally well. After two weeks and about a half-dozen uses the charge is still about 98% full. Don't know but I think that is pretty good. The pre-loaded video demonstration was awesome. Still have a few minor issues with the ease of use of the different menu screens but I'm sure with more time to play with it I will find it very accommodating. I have found the earphones that come with it quite good, but again I've not tried any other headphones with it. I mainly wanted an MP3 player to listen to tunes at the gym and to keep me entertained on upcoming plane travel. So this MP3 player is PERFECT for me. May run into 'issues' down the road, but so far I can say that this is a magnificent piece of technology. I did download the firmware from the Sandisk website (highly recommend visiting it before and after purchasing one of their players), which I think is advisable.  Yes, the buttons on the front are small but I have small fingers so it's not a problem - but could be for a guy or gal with larger fingers. The screen is a very nice size and seems to have very good resolution, although I did finding watching the demo videos a bit difficult and had to find the right angle to hold the player to see them more clearly. But I do think if you want this player for a lot of video downloads you will be pretty satisfied. I do wish (and hope) Sandisk starts producing more accessories specifically for the e200 series, but until that time there are many companies making accessories compatible with the series (can someone recommend which AC adapter charger is safest and best for this MP3 player?). All that said, I can say ""So far so Great!"" I think this is a very high quality, very user-friendly, durable MP3 player that is worth whatever cost you pay for it (and boy there is a wide range - I would just advise buying it locally and not on-line for the obvious reasons - possibly used, damaged, and if you have to return it you can run into a lot of headaches). I am almost embarassed to say I paid through the nose getting it at Wal-Mart, but if I need to return it it is much easier than having to mail it somewhere, and I was able to play with it before actually buying it. Just a personal choice.  I hope in a week or two I'm not dealing with a dead or dysfunctional MP3 player, but at the moment, early on, being a novice, I think this player ROCKS! I can highly recommend it, and I think if you are down to either a Zen or Sansa, go for the Sansa. The Zen is cute and offers a lot of neat accessories, is smaller and colorful, but the Sansa is far more durable, offers a larger screen, and in all just seems to be a more durable, better quality item. I wasn't even going to go near an Apple Ipod! The ""proprietary"" conditions with them regarding music downloads really turned me off, and in general the user reviews are not good. Check them all out in person and see what feels 'right' to and for you. But absolutely give the Sandisk a look. I am a very satisfied owner."

I am so pleased with the product that I had to post a review. Its a great quality product.. I dont like ipods for two reasons.. 1) accesories are so expensive 2) you cannot remove the battery. Several friends have ipods and the battery has stopped charging after a year or so (sometimes even months!) By the way.. I bought on ebay a kit including a silicon case,arm band, car charger adapter and AC adapter.. for about 10 - 12 dlls plus shipping.. they have worked just fine. A few tips for having a better experience with the sansa. First, install the latest firmware, my version had a issue with playlists, upgraded the firmware and the problem was solved. 2nd:  dont use windows media player for managing your music, in my opinion..it is horrible. I use Winamp, the free version and it works flawless...very easy and fast to transfer music. I have conected the Sansa to several PCs and download music perfectly. By the way, the FM reception is pretty good and sound quality is great. If you are looking for portable speakers.. get the JBL On tour, they can be used with any mp3 player.. sound great and are quite inexpensive(around 40 dlls on ebay) Dont hesitate to buy this product, you wont regret it... Enjoy your Sansa."

It served her well but she wanted an mp3 in which she could choose songs and create playlists.  She wanted an IPod because that's what her friends were using.  I have a Creative Zen Vision: M 30 with Napster subscription.  (Great mp3)  I guided her away from Apple and towards this because of the flash drive and Plays for Sure compatability.  Using her own money to buy this, I nervously awaited her verdict on the Sansa.  She loves it and so do I.  She has her music, photos and a movie on the player.  It works great with Napster To Go.  Her basketball coach saw her using it on the bus and has decided to get a Sansa also.  My 15 year-old son is now thinking he wants to get one, too.  Great product."

Since I'm in college, I use it not only to play music but to record lectures and the sorts. For some odd reason, the player 'creates' 4 folders and these extremely large setup files ( the biggest one on my player is 8 GB? ). On top of that, I can't record anymore. I'm not sure whats going on, but SanDisk needs to sift through these kinks and fix 'em. Other than that, its a great music player..."

The Sansa e260 series is easy to use, has a great set of features and functions and is (very) considerably lower in price then the equivalent iPod.  I've been using my Sansa e260 for a couple of months now and I just love it!  Unlike some of the other reviewers I have found no problems with the buttons and I find the user interface easy to understand and to navigate.  Keeping it charged is no problem ... just buy an inexpensive AC/DC to USB converter - works fine and you can keep using the e260 while it charges.  As to needing to use proprietary software to download movies; so what?  You're going to need to use some type of software to convert the files anyway, and the software supplied with the e260 does the job just fine."
527835,A1EJ6J6N9I7W35,0,1,709,B000ETVKHE,9/21/2007,5,6,7,Sweet piece of gear,"I've been using the E260 for about five months now, and it has been one of the better purchases I've made on Amazon. Sounds good, easy to use, fairly durable, reasonably priced, and it even looks good. One of my teenage son's friends checked it and said he liked it better than the Nano. I agree with him that the Sansa wheel is better. It's more ""sure-fingered"" and I rarely pick the wrong thing with it. The menus are natural, and quick to use. I often change music while moving on an elliptical exercise machine, with no problems. It coordinates reasonably well with Windows Media Player, so it's unnecessary to install any other software to use it. I can't say the integration is natural or perfect - it took some dinking around to get Media Player to copy over just the music I wanted. But I found a way I like even better, which is to access the device directly and just drag over the songs I want using Windows Explorer. The Sansa apparently just indexes them on the fly when I do that, because they appear in the menus right away. (The integration with Media Player was one of the main reasons I picked the Sansa, because I think iTunes is pretty sad, and the Zune doesn't work with Media Player either.) I can't claim the included ear buds are anything special, but that's true of most MP3 players. Maximo makes a nice set of ear phones ( ) specially tuned to the Sansa E-200 series, so I recommend you take a look at them if you want some high quality audio off the Sansa. Or just wear some decent, lightweight headphones. This unit is now a pretty good bargain, and you can bump it to 6GB by getting a 2GM car for about $30. But if you have a lot of music, you might want to spring for the 8GB model, the E280. I've filled up my E260 already, but I carry about fifty albums on it."
527834,AEVTLUYR5JC8H,0,0,708,B000ETVKHE,8/19/2007,3,6,7,I really want to like this player,"I did a lot of research before settling on this player, and I want to like it. It's small and sleek, and the sound is good. I have no problem with the dial and the buttons (my hands are small). But I find it extremely picky about displaying music I transfer to it. I've given it three stars because it's not working for me. But based on the other rave reviews (which contributed to my decision to purchase the player), I can see it has the potential to be a five-star device. I don't download individual tunes from the Internet. I want it to hold my ripped classical music CDs. Some of them show up in the Album and Artist views, others don't. When I'm in MSC mode and I connect the player to my computer, I see the albums in the folder, but I can't see them on the player. The tracks show up when I look at Songs, but that's no good because they're listed in alphabetical order and guess what, I don't want to listen to the first movement of a symphony followed by the first movement of another symphony, and so on. Call me a traditionalist, but I want to listen to movements 1 - 4 of one whole symphony. I don't think I'm stupid, but I am having a hell of a time figuring this thing out. I've tried syncing with Media Player in MTP mode and dragging and dropping in MSC mode. I've deleted the data folder so the device has to rebuild the database (per instructions for this problem on a forum). If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them."

Within the first 2 weeks of receiving this it started breaking down.  It would freeze up, screen would turn black, wheel would stay lit until the thing lost power.  Then I would have to charge back up to get it working again.  It got to the point that it was no longer working.  Sandisk sent me another one.  It was good until the same thing started happening again.  what happens now is the thing freezes up after 5 minutes and I again have to wait until it loses power to charge it again.  Sandisk sent me another one, only to have the Sansa break down the same way again. Since october 2006 i have had 3 sansa players of which both have failed.  I have now turned to ipod and feel that the product is so much superior.  The only good thing I have to say about the Sansa is that their customer service is great."

527831,A2TMO51OU827ZB,0,1,705,B000ETVKHE,1/11/2009,5,3,3,BETTER AN IPOD!,"If you are thinking of buying an IPod don't!  This is a whole lot easier, cheaper, and user friendly.  The Sansa does everything the IPod does, but a lot easier to program.  My son had an IPod and sold it to buy one of these.  With the IPod you are unable to go to a friends house and load a song that you like off of their computer.  With the Sansa you can load anything from any computer on to it no problem.  I personally use Windows Media Player to program mine, but I am sure there is other ways.  I also like the fact that you can delete music, pictures, ect off the Sansa without having to go through a computer.  You have to go through a couple of steps to delete things so there is no way you can accidently delete something.  Also buy your MP3 downloads from Amazon, they are only .79 cents.  I would recommend downloading (free) the program Amazon will ask you if you want on you first download.  I automatically puts it in Media Player or iTunes if you have already made the mistake with the IPod. With the expansion slot you can make this as big as you want.  But really..does anyone really put full cd's on their player when they only like maybe 4 of the songs?  Defeats the point doesn't it?"
527830,AFGLC9EDU5DDY,0,1,704,B000ETVKHE,11/10/2008,5,3,3,Excellent iPod alternative - get it while you still can,"I've been a Sansa owner since 2006, when I purchased an e280 (8gb) for myself. I've always been happy with the functionality, battery life, and sound quality compared to the price of about $200 at the time. Now I've purchased an e260 (4gb) for my wife. While it only has half the built-in memory, I've found this version to be superior for a few reasons. One thing I did not expect is that this is a ""version 2"" Sansa. They've improved many features over my ""version 1"". You can delete songs on the fly right from the menu button, which you can't do with the version 1. This is helpful when you listen to a lot of podcasts, as I do, and you want to get rid of them as you go so they don't clutter up your library. The response time on clicks to accessing menu features seems to be quicker too, and the scroll wheel has a smoother feel now. The main reason to look for a version 2 Sansa, though, is that it's compatible with the final firmware update from Sandisk. A version-1 Sansa can only be upgraded to firmware 01.02.24A. The version 2 can be upgraded all the way to the most-recent 03.01 release. Another reason to look for version 2 models is that they're compatible with the newer Micro SDHC cards, whereas the version 1 models only work with original Micro SD cards up to 2gb. The Sansa e200 models have lots of other great features, such as built-in voice memo recording, a built-in FM radio tuner, and support for playing videos and showing photos. The one drawback to these last two features is that you have to run your media through Sansa's media converter on your computer for them to work with the unit. This is where iPods would likely be superior with their plug-and-play functionality with iTunes. I will say, however, that I've been very pleased with how well both my e280 and my wife's e240 work with Windows Media Player 11. Overall, while you can still get them, the e200 players are great products. Make sure you get a ""v2"", though. You can tell by looking on the back of the unit. If the model number in the lower-right corner does not say v2, don't buy it. Sandisk has discontinued the e200s in favor of a new model called the Fuze. But the functionality is virtually the same, and you're likely to get a better price on the older models."
527829,A3M20W9ZQACULY,0,0,703,B000ETVKHE,9/14/2008,4,3,3,"Love it, but....","I bought this product (Sansa E260) simply to have a little more memory than my original SanDisk player, which is only a 256MB player - but still in great working order.  After a lot of researching, I settled on the E260 - even though it was older than the FUZE, Clip, and other models.  The replaceable battery was a big seller for me - as I didn't want to have it die after a year & then have to buy a whole new player. I love the extra memory, as now I can download radio podcasts (2 - 3 hrs of content) and listen to them at my leisure, without having to discard some music to make space. The possibility of playlists was also interesting me, as I also use the unit for learning songs that my band is playing, so want to group them together for easy access.  Also, being a magician, I was looking for a way to group the music for my act in one place and then play it from there.  An MP3 player allows for the easy changing of a show, simply by altering the playlist, rather than burning a new CD each time. Here is where the problem comes in: The player will not allow me to create playlists (at least, not in the manner that I expected).  Sure, it will add the music to the player, but won't keep a folder/file called ""Band Music"" (for example) that would contain that music in order to access the 5 songs I need, rather than all 200 on the player.  As you can see, for a magic show, this would obviously not work. There are work-arounds, but will be a bit of a hassle if I have to do it on a regular basis. ALSO - It seems that the player only allows two ways to decide the order of my music - either in ""Shuffle Play"", or by ""Artist"".  So - even if I play by grouping of Genre, when playing from the ""Country"" folder - it wants to play all of the Kenny Chesney songs, before moving on to any of the Brad Paisley songs (for example) - again, unless I want to ""Shuffle"" (which, by the way, resets the order every time you shut the player off - so you have the potential to hear the same 3 songs - in the same order - multiple times in a row - yes, it's already happened).  There should be a way to play a random mix of the songs in the ""Country"" folder - perhaps like in alphabetical order of the title (like my old player did). So - overall: Do I like it?  Yes - despite my complaining, I do like it quite a bit.  The controls are wonderful, after you figure them out. Is it better than my old 256 MB player?  Not even close (except for the memory). However, I realize that if I weren't set in my ways - I would absolutely love this player (except for the Playlist issue) - so yeah, go ahead and buy one! ------------------------- Okay - here is an update on this player - by using Rhapsody, it will allow you to create playlists - I was using Windows Media Player before.  Rhapsody will allow you to do this by downloading their software, but you do NOT need to purchase their service as long as you are only going to load your own music.  Now, it seems, my playlist issue should be a non-factor.  Hooray!! -------------------------- Another update (Feb-13-09): When using Rhapsody playlists, my player will FREEZE.  So, now I am avoiding using playlists of any sort and am doing a home-made work around.  Yes, it's cumbersome, but better than nothing!"

I typically use it for audio books downloaded from my local library. (I'm not sure Ipods read typical audio books).  4Gs is great -- you can store a lot of audio books on 4Gs -- great for working in the yard, commute hour and long drives.  When skiing, I load it up with a 2G microSD card full of mp3 files for music on the slopes.   I've also used it for storing/transfering data via simple file transfer.  Displays video fine, but it's kind of small.  Simple to use menu and very intuitive buttons w/volume wheel -- has bookmarks for audiobooks.

The expansion slot allows you to have endless memory as long as you have SD disks to put it on, making this item a good rival for the IPod Nano. The only down side I see is that to watch videos you have to convert them first.

I wanted a large capacity MP3 player because I didn't want to deal with the fragility of a hard disk player.  This is a great player, easy to use.  I've had it for about 4 months with no problems and I love it.  Volume is good, with a good range to it.  If it's not loud enough, there's a ""loud"" setting which really cranks it up.  Battery life is very good.  Fantastic value for the price. Pros: Battery life Good quality screen, looks good enough for video clips Micro SD card - unlimited capabilities if you swap these out! Ease of use FM radio, which comes in well if you are in or near a city Volume range Durable - metal back cover Customizable as well as preset equalizer User replaceable battery - don't have to throw out the player or pay for expensive replacement when the battery goes.  Currently a replacement battery is only about $20 from SanDisk. Cons: Start up time - about 1.5 minutes if the player is fully loaded.  Takes some patience. Storage of video - you can only store video clips on the built in memory, not on the Micro SD card.  Video must be in Quickplace format.  If you use the converter that comes with the player the files can get quite large. Button size - It's possible the buttons may be too small for someone with large fingers as they are somewhat recessed into the player.  I have small fingers so it doesn't bother me."

It has an expansion slot for more memory if the 4 gigs isn't enough, the battery can be replaced, and the screen is a nice size with excellent resolution. The only complaint that I really have with it, the ring in the middle protrudes a little too far and makes the smaller buttons on the outer edges a little difficult to press. Of all of the MP3 players that I've seen and played around with, this one ranks as tops, even over the Apple Nano, which has serious format limitations.

Instead of removing the battery, one should hold the power button for ten seconds.

It works great, easy to figure out how to navigate around the device, very clear and loud playback.  The color display is great.  I use the device with Windows Media Player to access my Napster subscription and it couldn't be easier to sync files to the Sansa.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I also purchased a device that lets me plug the player directly into the factory stereo of my car.  It really sounds great, very clear and loud.  I have a 70 minute commute and the battery lasts for two weeks!"

When I added all of my songs to it right when I got it, there was a bunch of songs I didn't like so I plugged it in and delted them from the music folder... When I turned it back on the songs were still there on the list. When I tried to play them it would come up with ""bad track"" and skip to the next song, it still does that to this day and is very annoying. But other than that it's a great buy."
527813,AHZ9U5T55RRUT,0,0,687,B000ETVKHE,6/1/2007,4,3,3,good player,A good player for the price I paid. The music (mp3's) is clear and the best feature is being able to watch movies on it after I have converted them. The only drawbacks to the player are that the radio is not crystal clear (probably poor reception) and it take a while for the movie to be converted. Defnitely a good buy
527812,A35SZY2HV5AAFE,0,1,686,B000ETVKHE,5/25/2007,5,3,3,Reluctant at first...  But turned out great,"I was in the market for an MP3 player, and read a lot about the various products before purchasing one.  I'd heard that the Apple Ipods were easier to use than other products which was a concern to me. But I also heard that they (Apple) saved their music using formats that only played on Apple products.  I really hate it when companies try to corner the market by limiting compatability so that you can only use their products.  But I was also concerned that the non-ipods would be difficult to use. After looking at the other choices, I decided on the Sandisk.  I went ahead and purchased the 4Meg memory version, but was also concerned that 4Megs might not be enough.  But didn't want to waste money on a more expensive product if it turned out to be too difficult to use. My concerns were alleviated after I received the player.  After downloading the Windows Media Player 11 from the Windows website, I found that it was very easy to use after getting used to some of the bells and whistles. I had no problem at all.  And the 4Meg memory was far more than I thought I would need.  I saved all my CD's (and then some) and did not even use half the memory. I would say if you use computers on a day to day basis like I do, you should not have any problem using the Sandisk with the Windows Media Player11.  Also for me 4Megs of memory is plenty for now at least.  I've really enjoyed this little player so much, and cant say enough good things about it."
527811,A178X8DGVMXGYO,0,0,685,B000ETVKHE,5/17/2007,5,3,3,Excellent machine!,This is my first MP3 player and I've been researching a lot trying to find one that will hold a lot of music and is easy to use. Have had my Sansa for about a week and it's just the cutest little thing. It was very easy to down load music from my computer and have even been able to add to that collection without any difficulty. I went to another website and found and charger that will allow me to plug into the wall socket so I'm very happy. It comes with adequate ear buds but like my old pair better. Really no complaints about this item. Would highly recommend it.
527810,A2WRY4WZEREI0E,0,1,684,B000ETVKHE,4/8/2007,4,3,3,Won't work with a mac! Otherwise great.,"Just a note to potential buyers who may have mac computers.  Previous generations of sandisk players would work on a mac, but this one won't.  I've just talked to two separate Sandisk tech support people who said slightly different things, but both said NOT to use it with a mac.  The first one said that the mac would corrupt its system, the second just said it wouldn't work right. In fact, it crashes my mac system if used as a regular USB peripheral would be, requiring a hard powerdown to unfreeze the mac. Do NOT buy one of these and assume it'll work with your mac. I do like the player, and would recommend it highly to you windoze users."

The bright colorful screen was a huge plus, easy to read, easy to navigate. Sound quality from the stock headphones was even above-standard. Features are great, just what you're looking for in an MP3. I like it because even thought it's small, it's not fragile or ""chinsy"" feeling like the IPod, or seems like it could be easily damaged by accident. Downloading is simple and painless. All around great buy. CONS: Be very careful with the screen - other reviewers were right, it scratches almost right out of the box. Get the travel pack, including the protective cases and scratch-proof screen cover at the same time of purchase, it's an immediate must-have. Other than that, would have loved to have the option of a package deal to avoid paying for each accessory separately, like most other MP3's (would've made the rating a 5)."

And thus, I settled on this one. goods -sturdy; not invincible, but sturdy contstruction -radio -fluid file transfer; just click and drag folders or files -good sound quality, and it has a volume inhibiter so you don't blow out your eardrums, you pantywaist, you. bads -has frozen up once or twice.  just unscrewed the battery cover, disconnected the battery, reconnected and closed up.  seemed to solve the problem -some files corrupted for no apparent reason (but then again, i'm no techie wiz).  ended up formatting the whole memory, and haven't had a problem since. quite pleased so far, so if you're like me and don't want an iPod because theyr'e EVERYWHERE, this is a purty darn good buy (and a hell of a lot less flimsy than the Nano)"

This is my 3rd player thru the years and the first that is actually ""branded.""  It is a jewel.  I see complaints about scratching, etc, but any small piece of electronics (think about your cell phones here!) scratch easily.  This player feels durable enough to me and the color screen has an extremely clear display.  I am not tied to a proprietary service that allows me to only play one type of music file.  The player syncs to WinXP as a flash drive; it is recognized and files can be dragged/dropped.  Complicated software is not needed for loading it.  For those who complain about the speed of loading, is your computer USB 2 compatible?  The radio, voice record, and video viewer are all great extras.  But... the one feature that prompted me to purchase this player is a **user replaceable rechargeable battery.**  That is a significant cost saving feature if you have ever owned something of which you could not replace the battery and had to pay a company for that priviledge!"

It's small enough to be nearly unnoticeable in ones pocket.  I  loaded it with music right away.  It took a while to charge (left it over night.)  The player sounds as good as an MP3 player can.  It's intuitive to use and has a lot of features not available on the iPods.  I highly recommend this line of MP3 player to anyone looking to purchase one.
527802,A1NJOXG3WDEOGJ,0,1,676,B000ETVKHE,2/2/2007,5,3,3,Pretty Good!,"Just got my e260 a few days ago, I'm just going to list the Cons I find since the Pros have already been discusseed greatly. 1) Buttons (especially the tactile wheel) suck and are placed awkwardly. I often find that I skip a menu item or a song because the scrollwheel doesn't always end up where I want it to. Buttons sometimes need pressing 2-3 times before registering. The Buttons are also placed too close to the scrollwheel, so that I hit the scrollwheel accidently. Not recommended for people with Fat Fingers. 2) Recharging slot and MicroSD slot are left open and exposed. After a while I'm sure they will fill up with dust. 3) My Sansa has crashed on a few occasions. This can be a bit of a pain as it takes 25 seconds to reset(15 sec reset+ 10 sec startup) and I lose the place where I was listening/watching. 4) Quicktime sucks, my 700 meg divx movie turned into 1 gb. Takes about 2 hours to fill up the 4 gb player with converted video 5) Bass is lacking. My 5 year old PNY vibe pumps bass way better than the sansa. But I'm a bass junkie and others might not have this peeve. 6) Controls are sometimes weird. For example, to power down I have to press the menu button once to get back to the main menu and then hold it down to shut down. Takes some getting use to. However, the quality, many options, battery life and good feel of the player has won me over."
527801,A1LRJG6XOXBFTO,0,1,675,B000ETVKHE,1/15/2007,5,3,3,WOW -- I don't understand the 'thumbwheel' issues :),"I got this in the mail last week. I have loaded 565 songs on it using Microsoft Media Player V10. I have 1688 MB free out of the 3700 available. I also ordered Shure E2C ear buds with it and don't use the provided units at all. I have boosted the BASS in the equalizer settings and have found everything to my liking. While I am educated about electronics / HDTV / Stereo, Home theater etc. this was my first foray into the MP3 world. I took the unit out of the box, saw that it played with the provided charge, opened my Media Player to see about Ripping a CD and the unit sync'd with the computer and I had my CD's on the player in less than 30 minutes. It doesn't get any easier than that. I believe REALLY good software / hardware doesn't need a manual - this unit rates a '5' of '5' with me. I put it in my jeans pocket, popped the Shure e2c ear buds in and spent two days rebuilding my fence - no problems with anything - I couldn't be happier. I thought the PRICE was excellent for the memory provided. Part of me says I should have gotten the 8MB unit, but the other part of me says ""with 1000 songs (potentially), you'll be fine"". I do not use it for video or photo's. I read the CD-manual and figured out to use WIndows Explorer and went in and deleted the factory loaded songs, pictures and all video files. I HAVE preset 6 FM-stations that come in very well considering I live in pretty much a jerk water town of limited FM resources. I am looking forward to receiving the FM-transmitter from iRiver so I can listen to this in my truck --- my car has the XM-radio :( I found the controls to be sensible and easy to use. I wear a Men's size 12 glove and my ring size is 12 as well --- I have large hands and find the controls easy to use and I simply do not understand the comparisons with the iPod -- other than the cost differential. All in all - I'd do it again in a heartbeat knowing what I know now."
527800,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,0,1,674,B000ETVKHE,1/9/2007,5,3,3,Superior product,"This is likely the best mp3 player on the market. I owned a previous SanDisk player, but didn't like the fact that it was AAA battery powered. Wasn't in too big a hurry though, so I took my time looking around. The most obvious first choice was iPod. I took a look at several offerings, and found them to be pretty varied. The cheaper models looked good, but they seemed a bit expensive for the functionality available. Additionally, I was put off by the fact that you can't use the player as a USB storage device. This is actually one of the major things I use these for, having it double as a media player and a flash drive. Next on the lineup were offerings by Samsung, Creative, and even Microsoft. Zune looked and felt too big and clumsy in general, as did most of the hard disk-based Creative players. I wanted the thing to fit in my pocket, not fill it. The Samsungs were small and cheap, but didn't have much storage space and all but the top-end ones had very small screens. Then there was SanDisk again. I must say, despite the fact that my old player didn't have what I wanted in terms of battery life/type, it still did work. Checking out the selection, I saw this player and settled on a mid-range 4 GB size. I'm pleased with the choice. Pros: Very nice screen. Good software that's pretty straightforward to use (just be sure to run the updater). One-touch voice recording. FM tuner with pretty good reception. Very long battery life, fast charging. Lots of storage space, and additional available via Micro-SD. Holds all my files, and then some. Very easy to sync with Windows Media Player. Battery is removable/replaceable. Just plain looks cool- on par with iPod Nano in my opinion. Cons: The included earbuds are lousy. Bought myself some new ones. Some buttons are a bit small. USB charging only with proprietary cable; requires a PC that's turned on (not a big deal in most cases). Can't seem to play directly from player while plugged in, though of course you can play from the PC. Relies on Windows Media Player for sync, file ID, playlists, etc., so if you don't like WMP you can still organize stuff, but it's a bit of a pain. Essentially this is an iPod Nano with much better software/compatibility options, slightly inferior hardware key layout, and much lower price. I think it's no contest which is the better deal."
527799,A1GRKHU3VZW9PW,0,0,673,B000ETVKHE,1/6/2007,4,3,3,Soo much better than the Ipod Nano!,"I got this 4GB Sansa two days ago and I'm very pleased with it.  I only paid 129.00 here at Amazon, compared to 169.00 at Walmart.  Anyway, I loaded over 2 hours worth of video (2 episodes of Family Guy and 2 episodes of Friends),and 300+ songs, and I still have 980Mb left!  It also has a Micro Disk slot so you can keep adding more files.  I was ready to shell out 250 bucks for the Ipod Video, I'm glad I bought this Sansa.  The only issue I have is with the buttons, it's kinda hard to press the buttons around the spin wheel, other than that, I'm quite satisfied.  I guess it just takes a little getting used to."
527798,A2PQQLXUWZ5D6X,0,0,672,B000ETVKHE,11/9/2006,3,3,3,Good but Glitchy,"If it worked perfectly, my Sansa e260 would be great. The music and video features on it are very nice, and it looks good aesthetically while also seeming to be fairly durable. Some people complain about the buttons, but I don't find them too troublesome. Basically, if everything worked as it should, I would really have no complaints about the e260. Unfortunately, my particular player has been glitchy since the day I bought it. The first day I had it it froze up. This was a minor thing that didn't really repeat itself too often (maybe once or twice more). Later on, however, I noticed something was wrong after a file transfer (basically, it wasn't playing half of the songs that were on the player). I plugged the player in and looked into its files - lots of corrupted folders and files. I contacted Sansa's customer service department (very quick and helpful), and I got the information I needed to fix the problem. That was about two weeks ago, but my player has developed a new problem since then. I can turn it on and get to the menu, but, if I try to play music, the screen freezes and then restarts. I can't say that all or even many of e260s have problems like this - maybe it's just my particular unit. However, in my case, the glitches and errors have really been a problem. I think this player would be excellent if everything worked properly though."

Since then, everything has been working excellent.  Easy music exchanges and downloads.  The screen is bright and easy to read. Some features such as the preset equilizer is useless.  I think the sound is best at the normal setting.  The video is actually good.  I was able to get an episode of Family Guy on it.  I haven't tried anything else yet. All in all, very nice product.  I can change the battery on my when (when it fails) and I can increase my memory without buying a new MP3 player (awesome).

I am tired of the fad with everyone having the all too popular Ipods.  This Sansa e260 is built well and looks great and the video and FM radio is a bonus.  The radio reception is OK and I plan to upgrade the headphones, as my wife agrees that purchasing a better set would improve the sound. The Sansa Media Converter is OK, but if you want to delete songs, I found it easier just to utilize itas a removable drive and deleting it using Windows.  Microsoft Media Player is also easy to use, but only for adding songs.  Overall, it is a good size and reasonably priced product.  I highly recommend it, dare to be different and steer away from the fad."
527793,A314CAGOWSJY6,0,0,667,B000ETVKHE,5/12/2009,5,2,2,It Needed Help,"When I first got the Sansa e260 I was disappointed and would easily rate it 1 star. It uses a database to hold ""song titles"" and ""albums"" which doesn't work well if you're a classical musical junky. I don't wish to listen to ""songs"" by themselves such as the second movement of Beethoven Symphony #5 so this thing was a potential disaster. Then I discovered the open source free Rockbox software for the Sansa. Wow! What a difference some firmware makes. Now ""albums"" are the directory title, such as Beethoven Symphony 5,  and when you select a directory it plays all the music in the directory. It also fixes the USB charging mode so that now the player controls work while hooked to USB. It also has a car mode that recognizes when the ignition switch is turned off which will pause the player, sort of like a GPS does.  There are many, many improvements too numerous to mention that make this MP3 player a wonderful experience to own. It does everything I could ever want in a player. The micro SD expansion slot is a huge plus. I can have different categories of music on little memory cards and swap it out for a different listening mood. As shipped, the e260 only takes 2gb cards but after installing Rockbox it will take the larger 4gb and up micro SDHC cards. The player hardware is of course rock solid with great sound and long battery life but the firmware it comes with is almost an afterthought. What was Sandisk thinking?  A few mouse clicks to replace the firmware however brings this device up to a 5 star rating. I am so glad I bought this player now."
527792,A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V,0,1,666,B000ETVKHE,3/20/2009,3,2,2,E260 experience report at 18 months - battery issue,"I bought an e260 18 months ago and it has served me well.  But now is the time to comment on how it has aged. My battery life was originally 15 hours or more, easily.  But now it is down to less than 2 hours, and even that is unreliable.  No matter how long I charge it, when I remove it from the charger the battery life indicator indicates only about half full.  And then after short use, the battery life indicator will go to red, indicating that it is low.  Once the display shuts off for awhile and then comes back on, the battery life indicator is back to green - for awhile. OK, time for a new battery.  One of the benefits of the Sansa compared to an iPod is its replaceable battery.  But none are available - not on Amazon, or elsewhere.  So much for that feature. Probably most people will just throw this device away after 18 months of usage because there is something better out there.  We do live in a throw-away society, after all. Just something to consider. I'm still not sorry I bought the Sansa.  It is irritating to see all of the iPod accessories (docking stations, etc), vs. virtually none for the Sansa, but despite the battery issue I am still relatively satisfied with this unit overall."
527791,A15DIVTLN9ATWN,0,1,665,B000ETVKHE,1/15/2009,5,2,2,Good player at a good price,"I purchased one of these just after Christmas last year (early 2008), and it has been a good performer so far.  The battery life is great, the 4 gig memory holds a good chunk of my music collection and the controls work well. My complaints are that, even on random play, it always starts with the first song in the memory; even with the base volume set to the lowest setting, it always starts out too loud for me and I have to turn it down; and it takes at least 30 seconds to start up with no MicroSD card and more than a minute to start with the SD card.  None of these would stop me from buying another. By the way, the one I bought was refurbished.  I wanted something that wasn't too expensive so I wouldn't be too unhappy if it was lost or damaged, and it wouldn't be expensive to replace.  So far, I am quite happy with my purchase."

527789,A12G7U8244UESV,0,0,663,B000ETVKHE,12/31/2008,4,2,2,Almost perfect,"Pluses:  Easy to use. Large capacity.  Slim design.  Does voice recording and playback just fine.  Is NOT an ipod so you aren't tied down to proprietary formats and subscription services. Minuses:  Nothing works well automatically ""synch""ing things to Windows Media Player including this item.  Fortunately, there is another format that allows your computer to see the player as just another USB drive.  That works great.  Don't try to use this device with any automatic software or services.  Just treat it as a pin drive that holds .mp3 files and things work just fine.  Due to WMP's fixation on all things USB, it is also a good idea never to have it connected to your computer when WMP is running or your files start flying around in unpredictable ways. The default mode (MTP -stupid mode) doesn't see your expansion cards - it says so right in the manual.  You have to use stupid mode to use any of the automatic online services such as Rhapsody or if you want automatic ""synch""ing to windows media player.  Since I think all those automatic services are nightmares and detest all the automatic features of windows media player, this is only an annoyance for as long as it takes me to change the mode to regular USB mode (MSC). My experience:  I purchased one in April 2007.  It lasted until December 2008 when it suddenly failed.  I purchased a replacement and will likely purchase a spare for when it eventually fails.  Problem with the newer versions of the firmware is that the option to turn off all that automatic ""synch""ing now has to be initiated by turning it off, locking the device, pressing rewind, then connecting to your computer and releasing when it is recognized.  Why not have me just rub my head and pat my belly while reciting the pledge of allegiance backwards?  After that, the option to select between stupid mode (MTP) and regular USB mode (MSC)appears on the menu like it used to in the old firmware version. Oh yeah.  Did I mention it is NOT an ipod so you aren't tied down to services and formats that Steve Jobs is trying to cram down your throat?"
527788,A33TR6H3MQ8CNH,0,1,662,B000ETVKHE,11/2/2008,5,2,2,Works Great,"So far I have no complaints about this device. It worked right out of the box. It did have it stop working temporarily, but I just did a soft reboot. You do that by holding down the power button for about 20 seconds, release it, then press the power button like you would normally to turn it on. The problem was caused by the player being connected to a third party car charger when the car was started. The only thing that could make this any better would be for it to have more memory, but that was more due to my impatience and lack of extra funds. It requires some software from Sansa in order to transfer videos and pictures to the player. I found the software to be very easy to use, with an uncluttered interface. The videos come out as clear as the original, and the audio keeps track with the video. The audio comes out great from the mp3 player, generally as clear as the source. I did not notice the ""cheapness"" that is suggested for the ear buds, they worked well if you have nothing else. The only improvement I would want for them would be some volume control. The player's audio setting has to be at its lowest in order to not blow out your ears with the provided ear buds. Adding playlists to the player is a breeze, just load up WMP, drag and drop the playlists in, and sync it. You can also just drag and drop your own songs in, but I prefer to just pre-create a playlist. The player does have a feature for creating a on-the-go playlist, but it could use a little tweaking for easier use. The radio feature works great, though it can have trouble with weaker stations. I love being able to store my favorite stations, it is prefered over my last mobile radio. Weaker stations come in clearer with a little tweaking of the headphone cord. The recording feature for the radio is also great, whatever you are hearing is what you get. I haven't gotten to use the mic function to much, but it seems to work fairly nicely. The only complaint is that it picks up movement from the user, or the click to turn off the recording feature. There is a record button on the side of the player, wich woudl work nicely if one has to make a quick recording. This could also work nicely for making a memo. All together, I am quite satisfied with this device."
527787,A1PPDBGCKM9AM0,0,0,661,B000ETVKHE,10/4/2008,1,2,2,Nothing but trouble from these,Bought 3 of these Sansa players last year for the family.  Since then have had nothing but trouble with them.  The problem lies in the software package that consistently fails and requires reformatting.  Must have reformatted each one about 5-7 times now - each time requiring that all the songs be reloaded.  The most recent problem resulted in one of the players (250R) not being able to reformat so now it is useless. Do not buy this product - spend a little more money and get something that actually works consistently.

The unit performs as advertised and with all its additional features is a great value. It's easy to use, loads quickly and performs impeccably. Other reviewers have commented about the lack of an AC charger or other accessories, but I purchased an AC charger, car charger, silicon (perfectly fitting) case and arm band from among the listed accessories at Amazon for unbelievably low prices. One issue, though, is that using Windows Media Player with Vista has a couple of glitches.  Artwork (album covers) doesn't sync, although Sandisk tech support apparently has a work around.  More problematic is that the music library synced to the unit won't display on Windows Media Player, and tech support told me it's a glitch with the Windows Media Player Software.  I found by changing a default setting (sync all upon connecting) this can easily be overcome, and gave the fix to tech support to disseminate. I recommend this unit highly!"

I spent hours trying to fix the problem until the e260 suddenly and completely died.  I sent it to Sansa but I don't expect any help . . .
527784,A3K0YCRM6SW4HX,0,0,658,B000ETVKHE,6/2/2008,4,2,2,Great IPOD Alternative.,"If you are one of the seemingly few people who are frustrated by the proprietary nature of the advertising giant that is the Apple IPod, than I would strongly recommend this product.  I've had mine for over a year now (standard for all of my reviews) and it is still going strong.  I run with it regularly and I'm no slouch when it comes to sweating.  I previously owned a Rio Carbon which lasted only a few months.  The Sansa however has been a wonderful replacement.  I can use Windows Media Player to maintain and sync my playlists.  It is quite easy and efficient.  Avoiding the contagion of IPod does have some disadvantages (hence the four stars).  For one, while nice and tidy, the design is not as small as some of the newer devices such as the Sansa Clip or IPod Shuffle.  Though this may only be a concern to joggers.  You can however play videos which you can not do on those other designs.  Finally and probably the most obvious drawback is the lack of readily available accessories.  They are available, just not at the normal big store retail sources.  Overall though, it's a great product which I ended up purchasing twice, one for myself and the other (6 months later) for my wife.  She loves it as well."
527783,A3FAC0V0XJFLAX,0,0,657,B000ETVKHE,4/27/2008,5,2,2,Solid performer,I bought this for my wife and it has made her happy from Day One. It has the perfect amount of memory for her and offers some bells and whistles far above similarly priced MP3 players. I highly recommend this player for its ease of use and outstanding features.
527782,A1NSJ1ELTTNNLF,0,1,656,B000ETVKHE,3/31/2008,2,2,2,The Facts Quickly!,This thing was great when I bought it but the scroll wheel felt a bit clunky.  Now a year later and the wheel barely works.   The titles jump all over when you turn it and you can't seem to ever land on the artist you want. The good thing about this is the price but it's a disposable unit like your portable CD player from before. Surprised for SanDisk.   They should stick to making flash drives.
527781,A1PJXJMNW2RYW7,0,1,655,B000ETVKHE,3/18/2008,1,2,2,"Terrible, find a different player","Player didn't last a month.  Top portion of display has permanent white lines.  After going around and around with Sandisk support offering ineffective software solutions to what is clearly a hardware problem, I am still waiting for (I hope) athorization to send it in for replacement under warranty.  In the meantime it is now turning itself off at random intervals.  Do youself a favor and buy something else. I wish I had!"
527780,A37SU6UE4RF63J,0,1,654,B000ETVKHE,2/10/2008,3,2,2,"Good MP3 player, could've used more interface","I purchased this MP3 player for my son, and after playing with it for a few hours, I wanted one.  I purchased an Insignia 4GB Sport from BestBuy, but returned it to buy this one.  I regret that decision now. This player is a good one, and it sounds great.  My only dislike is the user interface.  I use the rating system alot.  I don't have time to listen to every song I have loaded on my computer, so I copy them to my MP3 player, and as I am running (exercise), or sitting in a waiting room, I rate the songs, best to worse, then I delete the bad ones later.  The Insignia model had dedicated buttons on the side, so you can rate on the fly, the Sansa model you have to run through the Music menu to rate.  Also, the Insignia model would show you the rating on the screen while you were listening, the Sansa model, you have to go throught the menu again to see if you have already rated it. Also, I didn't realize I was buying a (version 1) MP3 player.  I guess there is a (version 2) with more features in the software, but I did not know that when I purchased.  I guess you can delete songs from the player with a ver2, but mine you have to connect to a PC to delete songs. The other thing I did not like is the inability to add songs to playlists on the MP3 player.  You can have different playlists, but the only way to change the playlists is to copy them from a PC.  The Sansa came with one playlist already loaded, called the GoList, and it is the only playlist you can change on the player. I guess I assumed that the best feature of an MP3 player would be that you can create multiple playlists for any occasion.  With this Sansa, you can have multiple playlists, but they did not make it easy for you, in my opinion. I do not use the movie or picture options.  To view a movie would take alot of the memory space needed for songs, and why would you want to watch a movie on such a little screen. On the good side, it has a good looking clear interface, has good sound, built in FM tuner, and decent EQ. My recommendation goes to the Insignia Sport models."
527779,AP76U923K286Q,0,1,653,B000ETVKHE,2/3/2008,5,2,2,I was skeptical but now I am sold,"I got the Sansa E260 for Christmas.  I thought about the IPOD but want to have the freedom to put anything on it not just Apple stuff.  I have yet to fill it up.  I have music, audio books, video and pictures on it. It has never frozen on me and the software works great.  I was careful to back up my computer before loading the software in case there was a problem but I have had nothing but smooth sailing.  The software converts all my video into the correct format.  I have updated the sansa software with no problems. I really like how it feels in my hand and how it operates.  I wanted something simple to use and easy to load.  I don't have hours to spend on  a computer working on the software when I want to change videos or songs.  I want to spend 2 minutes and unplug and go. The battery life is amazing it never seems to run down.  I watch videos for hours.  I spent 3 bucks and bought an power adapter for the wall so I wouldn't have to have my computer on.  I bought a nice case at Walmart by Case Logic that fits it perfectly. I have a 2 gig memory card but haven't needed it yet.  I listen to a range of music plus audio books and videos so I am never bored with this.  It's small enough to fit in my tiny purse and I can use it when I am waiting on my kids or doing some chore I would rather not be doing. Great for the treadmill and I love the ""lock"" function so I don't have to worry about pressing buttons by accident when I use it. It's nice to be able to show of pics of family and places I've been. I really like mine. Best purchase I have made in a while.  Found on sale the week of Thanksgiving through Amazon for 79.00! Sandi, Colorado Springs"
527778,A1TNUL9CPGO9SG,0,1,652,B000ETVKHE,2/1/2008,5,2,2,A great product,"I love this thing. I love the small size, the FM radio feature (though AM would've been nice), and the voice recording. The picture feature is nice, but the video featureisn't very usefull, as the software converts the video into a format that hogs up much of the player's 4 GB. Without videos, 4 GB is perfect for me and fits around 1000 songs. I love that you can drag and drop music into the folders of the player without having to go through clunky software (though pictures and video require the Sansa software). I wish the blue light around the center button wasn't so powerful, as it is quite noticeable in a dark room. It'd be nice if you could dim it or shut it off. Aside from these minor issues, its a fantastic product at a good price. Today, however, this model is a little dated, and you might find that you can get more for your money in newer MP3 players. Not saying that you shouldn't pick this one up, but be sure to do your research."
527777,A1Z3D9GL0DVHXM,0,1,651,B000ETVKHE,1/28/2008,4,2,2,not bad,I am familiar with sandisk memory cards that I use for my audio recorders and video games for my kids. They have been around a long time so I was interested in how they would do with an mp3 player and I think it's very good. I like the fact that you can essentially upgrade the unit by simply getting another memory card so that you could have an unlimited number of songs. Nice!
527776,ACZSAM5ZA37SP,0,1,650,B000ETVKHE,1/24/2008,4,2,2,Great item with a few issues,"I think it's a great MP3 player. The only problems i've had is it freezing a few times, but i can usually reboot it and it works fine. It has never frozen once it's been playing, only when booting up. Also, a few times it would not let me delete files from it in Windows Media Player. Usually I could just unplug it and start over and it has worked fine. Now it has frozen and I cannot get into it at all. I contacted Sansa and they are replacing it without any hassle, so good customer service also! All in all, a good unit and I am glad I bought it."
527775,A3LNTYH1VKB1UY,0,0,649,B000ETVKHE,1/23/2008,5,2,2,Great product!,I have had my Sansa e260 since September 2006 and love it. I use it mostly at the gym and it has survived several falls to the floor. This product was recommended to me by a coworker and I have recommended it to 3 people who have bought it and indicated they are very happy with the player.
527774,ANTYWI7M524DX,0,1,648,B000ETVKHE,1/19/2008,3,2,2,Happy and Dissappointed at the Same Time,"Regarding music, pictures, the voice and FM recorder, and the FM tuner, it works well.  My only complaints with any of these aspects are that I can't customize the Genre that is applied to each artist or song, and I can't create multiple playlists. As for the video feature, this player requires Sandisk's Media Conversion software (which was not included) to load video (and pictures) into the player memory. Even when I use the SanDisk Media Conversion software that came with my son's SanDisk SDMX7-1024 Sansa c240 1 GB MP3 Player, I was not able to get the video to play.  It works fine for displaying pictures, but when I go to the VIDEO folder on the player, it displays the word ""Empty"" even though the video is listed in the video folder of the player on my computer when I plug the player into my computer USB port. I have sent a question regarding this to SanDisk via their customer support website. We'll see how that goes."
527773,AAR8QIASU11V9,0,0,647,B000ETVKHE,1/2/2008,2,2,2,Disappointment,"This item worked great for about 5 min.  Unfortunately, it died after that and only worked when plugged into a/c or USB port.  Battery did not charge. Since I was really wanting to use this player for running, it was quite a disappointment.  I gave it 2 stars for how I think it probably would work with a battery and for the semi-helpful customer service.  However, I still haven't received my reimbursement after almost 2 weeks... that's a generous 2 stars."
527772,AU245PLVWG2C5,0,1,646,B000ETVKHE,12/26/2007,1,2,2,Not very user friendly,"I wanted an MP3 player that was easy to use as I am lacking some of the sophicated skills required for some of the newer electronic gadgets.  This Sandisk MP3 player did not want to help me connect and navigate my Vista system.  I called the company and they were useless and the suggestions offered did not answer my questions.  A subsequent e-mail only sent me to a discussion group that didn't even address my concern about compatability between the MP3 player and Vista.  Nowhere in the instructions were there any references to Vista.  I ended up sending the player to my grandson for Christmas and with his Windows XP he was able to use it.  I can't be the only user out there with a Vista system and this player.  Hopefully the company will address this problem and be able to offer valid responses and or ""fixes"" to the questions of their customer's that recieved this product for Christmas."
527771,A1QD7GSIVI81I8,0,1,645,B000ETVKHE,12/21/2007,3,2,2,It started off good...,"When I first got my Rhapsody account I thought it would be great to have an mp3 player that would be compatible with the software.  When I learned of the Sansa Rhapsody, I was elated.  I bought the player and it was pretty impressive.  It's thicker than the ipods of course, but it still had a very small shape.  The screen was amazingly crisp and clear (still too small to watch a movie on for long periods of time, though).  It also comes pre-loaded with about 4 hours of decent music.  The navigation was fairly straight forward and analogous to that of ipods, so it didn't take long to adapt.  Battery life was pretty good too if you cut down how long the backlight stayed on (probably 10-12 of audio hours on a charge). I started to become disappointed with the player though, about 6 months after I owned it.  The player would randomly freeze and I would have to hold the power button for 15 seconds to get it to shut down.  The player would also randomly turn itself off for no reason at all which was really annoying when I was working out.  I also didn't like the factory programmed EQs, or the custom EQ: They just didn't make the music sound quite the way I wanted it to.  Oh, and the sansa took about 15-20 seconds to boot up, which seemed like forever when you just wanted some quick tunes. All in all it is a decent player.  I will never buy one again due to the fact that mine will no longer power up or connect to my computer after about 10 months of use.  It is, however, a low cost alternative to the iriver clix Rhapsody.  So if you want a less expensive mp3 player that works (for the most part) with Rhapsody, go with the Sansa."
527770,AISWT1XKI3A7D,0,1,644,B000ETVKHE,12/15/2007,3,2,2,Not too bad,"I've had this since August. It works pretty well. The sound is clean, it's easy to manage the directory, and so on. But right off I had a problem using various media players to manage its content and playlists, and fell back on using its ""I'm a USB drive"" mode to transfer content (which also involved finding the hidden Music folder). Then, about a month ago, it began to crash on me. It was rare at first, but now it crashes mid-song several times a day. The only way to fix it is to yank the back panel and pull the battery. Its physical durability is pretty decent. I have a very rough lifestyle, and everything I carry gets dropped, scratched, or battered at some point, not to mention exposure to dust and extreme temperatures. Aside from a crack in the screen and some paint on the back panel, and the aforementioned crashing problem, it still functions."
527769,A1MKVPO2KWUKQJ,0,0,643,B000ETVKHE,12/7/2007,4,2,2,Great bang for any buck,"It's small and light, which makes it great for an active user. The included software works like a charm and drag and drop loading is a snap. The sound is quite good. I am no audiophile, but I will say that with a decent pair of headphones or ear buds it will come alive with clear highs, solid bass and everything in between. If you are not really happy with the sound there are plenty of EQ presets to satisfy your sound desires. The screen is pretty good as well. I did not have any intentions to watch videos on it, but now that I have it, I can definitely see myself loading up a few vids to watch on a trip or something. It's more than adequate for podcasts. The e200 series has some neat features and alot of them are even useful. There are some that are not really needed though. Who wants to record FM radio? But it's there... On the other hand, the scroll wheel is not the best in the world. Nothing drastic, and you'll get used to it, but it could have been a little better. Also the screen gets hairline scratches quite easily. They are not all that bad and can't be seen when the screen is on, but Sandisk could have coated it a bit better. All in all I can whole heartedly recommend the Sansa e200 players. Awesome value for a feature rich, great sounding little player. Edit: I also wanted to point out that Rockbox works perfectly on this player and even expands on the features and enhances the sound a bit. Though the battery life suffers from using this firmware."
527768,A2WLUEDNAQ4U7T,0,1,642,B000ETVKHE,11/11/2007,4,2,2,Nice MP3,I got this so I could listen to music during my commute but I also wanted the freedom of being able to listen to the radio as well.  Nice mp3 player.  Works well.
527767,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,0,0,641,B000ETVKHE,11/6/2007,5,2,2,I love this mp3 player!,"This was everything that I was looking for in a portable music device and more. Within minutes of removing it from the box, it was synced up to my laptop and I was loading music onto it.  Very user friendly and intuitive. I didn't want an iPod because I didn't want to convert all my WMA music files to iTunes and I didn't want to feel so limited with a proprietary device as the iPod (although friends who own iPods love theirs).  I wanted something that was affordable, held a reasonable amount of music and would accept mp3s and WMAs with no muss or fuss.  This was it. The design, size and shape is hot and fits comfortably in my hand. The sound quality is really good (although diehard audiophiles may feel differently).  The screen is bright, the colors vibrant and the size just right (I only use this for music so I can't speak for the video or photo options).  I like the bonuses of an FM tuner, voice recording and the ability to record FM broadcasts too. The price was right and dirt cheap at the time of purchase from amazon which made this a sweet deal. Unlike others, I have only had two slight problems with my player.  Sometimes I would lose sound in the left ear.  I would either restart the system or wait a few seconds and it would do a sizzly staticy fade in. I soon discovered this only happened when I used the custom EQ option.  Switching back to a factory EQ setting immediately restored the sound.  Since the custom EQ doesn't do much anyway and the tabs aren't labeled, I don't feel I am missing out on much. And I am having a heck of a time getting it to display my album art. However, that's an extra but not necessary feature for me. I will suss out the solution later, or not at all. My only beef is not being able to connect this to an exterior sound system via the USB port but using a headphone audio cable connector thingy allowed me to connect it to my stereo system. Other quickly solvable beefs I had at first were having to charge the battery through the USB port.  Quickly solved by purchasing a Sandisk AC charger through amazon for an unbelievably low price. Also, the control buttons are tiny and hard to press and the surface of the player scratches easily. I also occasionally pressed the voice record button by accident but not as often as other reviewers seemed to.  All of the above were quickly solved by purchasing a Speck Products toughskin case also available through amazon.  It's a thick stylish casing that adds great grip to the unit, comes with a durable removable belt clip, a screen protector, recesses the control wheel, makes the control buttons easily accessible and prevents the record button from accidentally being pressed (you have to push hard and firmly to activate the record button). Also, the headphones that come with the unit are not the best.  I use my Sony Fontopia headphones. Overall, for this being my first mp3 player I am highly satisfied and would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple, easy to use player.  However if you're a diehard technophile you will probably hate and gripe about little things that won't bother the average user. But for the average joe, you can't go wrong."

Most videos must be converted to a Sansa format and that can take a while. Another complaint is that although you can enter the date and time, you cannot display it. Otherwise, great product!"
527763,AU4QMSTKZ1CZ0,0,1,637,B000ETVKHE,9/10/2007,5,2,2,It works almost perfect!,"I bought this for my cousin, and he has not reported any problems as yet, so I think this is a very good mp-3 player. He accidentally pressed the off button for more than 7 seconds, so it turned off, and he thought the device got hanged. But when he called and asked SanDisk, he was told that it went into standby when he did that. Other than that, the product is great and also, you can add a micro sd card to increase the number of songs you can play, and has an inbuilt fm tuner....and I guess these are the advantages when you are comparing this and an ipod nano 4gb. The audio is as good as ipod, and I dont know about the video quality because I have not used that yet. But if you are not going to play any video, and are going for something other than an ipod (may be because of the price) this is the best alternative."

The product works well enough, although I have experienced blue lines running across the screen during the music transfer process. This has happened a few times, but I was able to reset the Sansa with no loss of data. I've owned this item for about 7 months and use it 2x a week maximum. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the item - it has proven to be too big for jogging/walking, and once you add a protector case (which is a must), it gets quite bulky. I have not used the video, picture, or voice features at all, I barely need 2GB, and in the sun the screen is useless. My advice: just be very careful to not buy more than what you really need in an MP3 - save as much as you can so you can upgrade more often. The product is easy to operate though and has held up, so I'd recommend it to people who are considering it."
527761,AJ7PH1CQ8BFYI,0,1,635,B000ETVKHE,8/29/2007,4,2,2,Like it,"Size of the player (both physical and memory) is great.  The only downside is the fact that the battery has to be charged from a computer through USB.

This was the best decision I ever made.  At first, the player kept skipping out or doing some weird stuff.  But, then I called SanDisk Tech. Support and found out that the firmware on the player was outdated and needed to be updated.  After the firmware was updated, the player worked fine.  The buttons are a bit tiny, but I would have tiny buttons rather than dropping the player and the player not working.  It is a bit of a pain to get the songs deleted from the player."

It plays well, and while the instructions that came with it were essentially useless, after playing around a bit I figured out how to get my music sync'd on it by just using my windows media player. The ear pieces that came with it are fine, but hard to keep in my ears when I am moving around alot. I use it primarily at the gym so I am looking for something that stays put better. I like the controls on it, and I like having the lock switch on it. So far I haven't had any trouble with it playing and the battery seems to last a pretty decent time. That, of course, may all change later, but so far so good. I am glad that I went with something other than the ipod."

I was so surprised and impressed when I opened the box, plugged in the player and started uploading music onto it.  I really expected to have to download some software and do some formatting etc. but I didn't have to do anything and it was great. As far as functionality goes, it's super easy to use, very small and lightweight and offers lots of fun features I didn't even know it had (like photo and video storage). My IPod loving boyfriend was a little envious.  I think this is a wonderful mp3 player and have absolutely no complaints."

I ditched my ipod nano for this Sansa. And so far i am not regretting it. It has more features than the nano. The only things that the Nano beats the Sansa in is that Itunes automatically loads music onto the nano and the click wheel is a little better, well the sansa's click wheel isnt as sensible as the nanos and that sometimes is a good thing. I really love the Sansa, and like i said i used to have a nano, and i totally like the Sansa better. Don't Believe the hype."
527756,A3QC18AP5GQHS6,0,1,630,B000ETVKHE,5/16/2007,5,2,2,What A Deal?,I love this Sansa it's great! I didn't think I would like it because it was so small but the fact that its small makes it so much better. It is really easy to use and transferring music to it is wonderful and easy. I really wanted to get an Ipod but it was so expensive but thank goodness I found this sansa because not only was it less expensive but it is better than an Ipod. When I get tired of listening to my music I can just flip to the fm tuner and listen to the radio.
527755,A1VQQDQHNJPKP1,0,1,629,B000ETVKHE,5/16/2007,4,2,2,Worthwhile if....,"This mp3 player is amazing. It is the best deal for the money that you can get. There are minor flaws- one of which is the relatively poor reception for many radio stations. But that's forgivable unless you want to record a song from the radio. Even the fact that this MP3 player has that feature is cool! Probably the most worrisome feature is that this MP3 player is prone to freeze up for no reason whatsoever. This can be remedied by waiting for the battery to drain, than recharge it. In a really bad freeze, if you have the luxery of having siblings with a player, simply delete the internal files and copy the them from a good player. It's only happened 3 times between 3 players over half a year and the good news is, it seems to be linked to the magnet on the popular cases that are sold for these players. Keep it away from magnets and it should be fine. I'm happy with it. ~ET"

I found the software confusing at first, but I figured out by trial and error. It was hard to get used to the buttons since I am so used to my ipod. I wish it had a belt clip since the lanyard is kind of awkward. Overall, I'm pleased with this product & I do like the colorful screen!"

I did not want to buy the same thing as everyone else, plus I don't like Apple products. So I went in search of the best possible alternative and this is it. With 4GB of space, video and picture capabilities, an awesome full color display and a blue light up wheel it offers more than the ipod in its sleek design. The only downside I have found is that if you have a case over the player it is sometimes hard to push the menu button (lower left corner). But other than that it is great. Customize playlists with Rhapsody and charge the battery right from the computer."

I wanted something that was small and simple, no disk, just for music, lots of solid state memory, good battery life, and I didn't want to get locked into iTunes. I chose the Sansa because it fit my criteria and is ""PlayForSure"" so I expect it to be supported in future versions of Windows for a long time. All in all the Sansa has lived up to my expectations. It is slick looking (iPod like) and has great battery life. There were a few UI quirks that took getting used to but overall I am happy with it. I am really happy that it integrates well with WMP without loading any extra software."

It also has a built-in voice recorder that I'll use when traveling to make notes about pictures I take.  No more tapes to bother with!  The only thing with which I am not satisfied are the ear buds.  They are uncomfortable and don't stay in my ears very well.

I have my entire cd colletion on here at 128 mbps with a little under a gig of space left. the factory sound quality is not that great but it has a custom eq with 5 different sliders so after about fifteen minutes of tweeking I got this thing diled right in. Ditch the factory headphones Im using a pair of sony Highest end ear buds (non sound isolating) and the bass hits as hard as my car. battery lasts forever. Read some reviews about synching taking for ever.. If you down convert the bit rate from your computer to the player it has to convert the file before it synches and yes this takes forever. But if you turn of the auto synching in windows media player after the initial download. it only takes like two minutes or less to add a cd. have not tried video or pics. Would never do the pics but I wouldnt mind trying the video wish i would have gotten the 6gb unit.. I cant compare to i pod as ive never owned one but I am perfectly pleased with this unit.. My only complaint is that it took me a while to figure out that auto synche deal..
527745,A14ZR2W7VJBAVA,0,0,619,B000ETVKHE,2/21/2007,5,2,2,Perfect for me,"This is an excellent device.  Its easy to use right out the box. Very stylish, I love the blue glow spin wheel. the sound quality is great, but the ear buds it comes with are not. I have my own much better pair that made a difference in sound quality. the video play back is very clear and crisp even for the small screen.  The recorder is excellent for radio and voice. The expansion slot is a great extra feature. If you can find a card on sale you can upgrade for far less than paying for the next level built in storage. The buttons take a little adjusting to if you had an ipod, its not a click wheel but not to difficult.  The menu/power button is odd but not a terrible feature.  The only hang up is no bookmarking for audio books. In all it is a great portable media player that I'm glad I purchased."

I love the size, the feel, rhe battery life, the sound, and the FM tuner. Most of its drawbacks have to do with managing your music and navigating through the device.  The buttons need more tactile feedback -- it can be hard to tell when you engaged them. I often hit the record button by accident (it is on the side). There is no back button, so often you have to go back to the main menu to select a different album.  It seems like you can only create one playlist.  I've also found editing the music somewhat irritating.  The best way to do it is to drag and drop from your music folder with the device in Flash Mode - this way it is easy to go back and delete folders or songs.  When you load music with WMP there is no way to delete unless you delete it from your music library and then re-sync the device - if there is another way I haven't figured it out. One time it shut itself off and wouldn't turn back on.  Apparently it froze - when that happens you have to hold the power button down for two minutes to re-set.  I had to call Sandisk to figure that out. Overall it was a good value, and the drawbacks are mostly just a just a little irritating rather than serious problems."

I believe there is a market for things big enough to see without straining the eyes or so small you need teeny fingers to use the product , I have one of the earlier -small- SanDisk players and I enjoyed it - but cursed every-time I loaded it or tried to get a station without glasses. Like all the features - but what sells me is the size and ease of seeing and pushing the controls I want to without wondering what I will get. When will these manufacturers realize there is a market for some of this oversized stuff and stop making everything so small they cut themselves off from a market that would but if they could use their product with ease.

As for video, the small screen is plenty crisp enough for those bus/subway trips across town.  The software is nice and intuitive for easily syncing media.  The only drawback is the mechanical scroll wheel, which feels a little flimsy and is in the way of the function keys.  It's easy enough to get used to, and the flimsiness seems to work it's way out with time, weird. With its price per GB or feature ratio, the Sansa will give the Nano a run for it's market share.  For anyone looking to get into the portable MP3 market, it's defiantly a device worth looking into."

The shuffle within genre is very nice as well.  Sound quality is pretty good, but I did notice a little hissing.  I don't think it's due to this player though because the same hissing happened with me Creative Vision M (also a very nice MP3 but costs twice as much).  The size fits very nicely into the hand.  People have complained that the wheel on the player feels cheap.  Doesn't bother me in the least.  I have very small hands so maybe that is what they are feeling.

This is what enticed me to this product. I was able to add 2GB for only 30 bucks. Well, every time you turn it on, it has to ""refresh"" the player and add all 2GB to the player. Therefore, everytime i listen to it, I have to wait about 10 minutes for the data on the expansion card to load on the product.

I have recorded tunes while listening to my favorite FM station and made them part of my library on the Sansa. Listen to Albums, Artists, Tunes or just pick a spot in the tune library alphabetically and let them play just like you are your own DJ! However, must confess that I have already upgraded to the E280 (8 Gbytes) because I was running out of space with only 4 Gbytes. Have stored everything -- all my new tunes and old albums complete (Beatles, Barbra, Cher, all Andrew Lloyd Webber shows, and much more). Will I update to the ""Connect"" just to go live on WiFI?

First, it comes with some songs preloaded, and some of those files are actually empty and the player still displays them after I've deleted them from its hard drive. (??)  Second, because I use iTunes, and it doesn't support m4a files, I have to convert a lot of my music to mp3 for it, which is time-consuming and doesn't work for protected songs (like anything you bought from Apple).

It's still frozen, 4 hours later. I cant get it to do anything, even shut off. Even if it starts working again Im returning it. The buttons are hard to manage too. Im getting a refund and getting an Ipod. Final conclusion....DONT GET IT!"
527721,AH0IHGQ9MB9H9,0,1,595,B000ETVKHE,9/8/2006,4,10,14,Regarding video & conversion,"Overall I like the player, especially what I paid for it.  Albeit it has a small screen, I'm interested in how it does with converting movies.  I couldn't find any good reviews that covered this, though I didn't read them all.  So here's a little info regarding video and video conversion... Converting your personal DVD's...  It's fairly easy, however you'll need to use DVD Decrypter or DVD shrink or some kind of ripping software first.  The reason for this is because most DVD's have various audio tracks and for some strange reason the ""Default"" audio track seems to vary within the VOB file of a movie.  So your converted content may switch from English to French in the middle of the movie.  So you need a ripping tool like the ones mentioned above to remove all but the one desired audio track. DVD Decrypter is nice in that it will let you rip a DVD into a single gigantic VOB file, and there's a reason you may want to do this, I'll explain later.  The other reason is that there is a plug in for DVD Decrypter which will take care of a cylinder redundancy (Copy protection) issue that exists on some DVD's.  The rub with DVD Decrypter is that you can not really edit the movie other than removing cells, which is very limited... DVD shrink has an advantage in that you can edit / crop a movie however you like.  However when you go to rip it, it will do it in the standard DVD format, which isn't a problem for the Sansa media converter, it just has to deal with multiple files instead of a single file. Converting using the Sansa media converter...  Basically the converter converts most any source content (including raw DVD VOB files) to a QuickTime format that is not well compressed.  The lack of compression suggests a weak processor or cheap codec, not sure which.  This is also evident in that pictures are converted into uncompressed bmp files, and recorded audio is uncompressed wav files.  So even know it has the power to play MP3 and WMA files, movies, pictures and regular recorded audio are uncompressed and hence large.  As an example I converted an MPEG file originally 8 megs and it came out at 47 megs after the conversion.  I'm not that familiar with the registered QuickTime Pro which can do all the high tech conversion as it's not freeware.  So it may be for the enthusiasts out there you may find a better way to convert things to QuickTime format and just drag & drop to the player... Overall it's truly a shareware like piece of software.  It certainly does what it claims; however there is no options whatsoever, unlike the Quicktime Pro editor.  This is truly sad as it could be much more powerful than it is.  So it can convert almost any type of content on a file by file basis, but being limited, there's no way to merge content from separate input files into one output file.  However this can surely be done via other software out there.  Also if you're converting longer content like a TV show or movie, the converter will break up the output files into 10 minute segments.  According to a Sandisk CSR, this is because the player will lock up if the files are longer than 10 minutes.  Luckily the Sansa player will move from one video file to the next, however there is a few second delay, so it's not a nice seamless transition. As far as converting normal mpeg & avi files, I haven't done too much of this other than to say it worked somewhat.

I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again. =============== Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use. Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one? ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09) Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day! Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market.

527719,A2TIJYZHR0K60U,0,1,593,B000ETVKHE,7/19/2006,3,14,20,Only buy this if you have no preferences whatsoever,"Let's start with the good stuff: this product is nice looking, it's light, compact, and easy to navigate.  Customer service is exceptional considering the state of customer service in this country.  The sound is very decent for such a small flash player, although I had a hard time finding a comfortable spot for the earbuds. Now for the bad: this player froze up after only two weeks of use, and although I was able to fix it within only minutes on the phone with customer service, it didn't fix the problem completely.  I had to re-format the player, erasing everything I had put on it in two weeks, but the drive space was still showing as filled, which took another call to customer service to figure out. It is absolutely impossible to put anything in any kind of order on this player.  With music that's not really a big deal, but when you're trying to download an audio book with 150 different tracks, it's a little important to be able to download track 1, 2, 3, 4 etc...Because, well, the book progresses that way.  I can't really follow the story if I listen to track 23 then track 14 then track 142...It's a little confusing. And, it's also a little bit of a pain to have to scroll through 150 songs looking for track 2, then 3 etc. The software they provide, rhapsody, is garbage.  I must have reorganized about 1,000 tracks on my computer, redoing the ID3 tags for music and audio books, so that when I downloaded them it would all be under the same title, genre, whatever.  Well, after spending hours and hours redoing all my audio files so I could download them in a relatively organized manner I thought it would be nice to put them on my mp3 player, but as soon as I dropped them into the player through rhapsody, it reverted all my files back to the original id3 tag (which customer service was baffled by). Playlists are also quite a problem on this.  You can't simply create a playlist while on the computer, you have to go to every individual song you want on the playlist to select it, then find the next song, select it, and so on.  It was too much of a hassle. In short, do your research, and make sure that you are getting the right type of player for your needs.  If you plan on listening to anything in order, don't buy this player.  What I have found is that it pays to do your research, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money for ""nicer"" products."
527718,A28XEJ21FGI5Z7,0,0,592,B000ETVKHE,5/26/2009,4,1,1,"Good unit, a few issues","I chose the Sansa e260 4GB because I read reviews about it online that said it had an expansion slot for a microSD up to 8GB.  This would allow me to put all my music on the player.  When I got it, it would not read the 8GB microSD card.  I found out that the version I bought was an older version of the same model number, and it only handles 2GB.  SanDisk should have given different model numbers to the old and newer models so people like me wouldn't be tricked into buying the wrong item.  Also, the seller and Amazon should have posted the 2GB limit on the microSD card for this purchase.  They didn't, so buyer beware!  Ask questions before you buy! My second issue is the volume.  There is only two volume setting on this unit, and both are too low.  I plug my mp3 player into a boom box so I can listen to it without headphones.  I have to crank the volume on the box excessively in order to hear it.  Thankfully, I only use it at work where I have to keep the volume at a low level.  But if I wanted to do the same at home, I wouldn't be able to crank it up without passing into the boom boxes distortion level. The random play feature is excellent.  It baffles me why other manufactures don't include this feature.  Who wants to listen to the same songs, in the same order, every day?  Also the e260 menu system is very easy to use. Bottom line, if I had to purchase another mp3 player, I wouldn't purchase a SanDisk again unless they fix the volume level and change thier model number system so they don't have the same number for players with differing capacity."

After purchasing it, along with an 8GB microSD card, I discovered that when I inserted the microSD card, the player did not detect it, and the extra memory it was supposed to provide was not available. After several hours of trying to determine what the problem was, and thinking that either the player or the microSD card was defective, I discovered an online forum that explained the problem to me: Apparently this player may come with one of two versions of the firmware that runs it - if you have a Version 2 player, you'll have no problems, and the microSD slot will work as advertised. However, if you have a Version 1 player, you cannot use a microSD card larger than 2GB - and if you do, the player will not detect it and you will not be able to use the additional memory. Oh, and it's not possible to upgrade from Version 1 to Version 2, so once you have it, you're stuck with it. Luckily there was a solution, albeit not one I'm entirely happy with: you can download the rockbox software and install it on your player, which will enable the player to detect the full 8GB of additional memory (see [...]). Unfortunately (in my opinion), rockbox is not as simple or user-friendly as the firmware that comes with the player, but additional memory is more important to me than user-friendliness, so I'm forced to live with it. My advice: Make damned sure you know whether you're getting a Version 1 or Version 2 player before you buy!"

I download files from NPR and load them to the MP3 and listen when I can. It is great for this. I also load my audiobooks to it from Audible. I actually own two of them; the second I bought when I thought me first was a goner but found it in the couch. I did buy the rubber cover and it makes it easier to keep track of.

My only complaint is that they both freeze from time to time.

It comes with a built in FM radio and voice recorder (you can record the radio as well). What I don't like is the video/pictures.  The screen is a little small to view pics or vids.

Lots of features, lots of storage, good sound quality, easy menu access through the scroll wheel.  Having to convert photos and video through the proprietary software was a drag, and apparently there is a firmware bug that caused the player to crash repeatedly and with increasing frequency, to the point where it would crash while it was rebooting.  Fortunately, Sansa has a firmware patch on their website, so the problem is easily remedied.  JUST DON'T DROP IT.

Well now I see what all the raves were about! I am totally impressed with my new toy! I put the majority of my favorite songs, some you tube videos, some video podcasts and a slew of pictures and I still have over 2gigs left, with the capability of expansion with the SD slot. The photo quality is superb, videos are clear and totally watchable despite the somewhat small screen. Pictures can be put on a slideshow while you listen to your favorite playlists. Battery life is excellent and cheap USB chargers are available for under $20 which is something you may want to consider for travelling, otherwise the USB computer port works fine. Sound quality is superb also and it is very user-friendly. I have only two complaints, one is with the operating/conversion software which I had to download and the metal back developed a slight discoloration perhaps due to perspiration. Really helps pass the time on airline flights and bus/train trips. I highly recommend it and it's priced right too."
527698,A1XYRHHRUVW5FN,0,1,572,B000ETVKHE,6/3/2008,3,1,1,"A decent player, with a few quirks","I've owned the 4GB e260 for some time now, and it has served me rather well- but there are a few issues that users need to be aware of before buying. This player was the most feature-rich 4GB player on the market when it came out, and to my knowledge it is still the only one (aside from newer Sansas) with an expansion slot. 1 or 2GB cards aren't terribly expensive, and will run you significantly less than a new player will, so this feature alone is sheer brilliance. I also like that the case is easy to open and the battery can be taken out and replaced, which gives the Sansa a great advantage over comparable players. Now for the cons: - First off, never, ever allow the USB/charger connection port to contact any metal object. This WILL cause the player to short out and lock up, which in turn requires you to either wait for the battery to run down or crack the case open and remove the battery for a hard reboot. I don't know if this is a common issue with other MP3 players, but I've had this happen several times as the port is very exposed. A simple silicone tab cover would have gone a long way towards preventing this from happening at all. -There is a possibility that, if the screen is set to automatically turn off or dim until a button is pressed, it may not come back on at all or it may lock up or display a blank screen. Running with the screen always on does not seem to significantly affect battery life, but this is something that should have been avoidable. -The scroll wheel is not as durable as it ought to be; it can and will become worn out long before anything else goes wrong with the player. While mine hasn't failed, it also doesn't recognize control input as it should; moving the wheel even slightly results in scrolling either far too quickly (all the way down a 20-some item menu from 1/16th rotation sometimes) or even scrolling in the wrong direction. This is not a crippling issue, as the play/pause, forward, back, and menu controls double as directional buttons, but it is highly annoying. -In addition to being of inferior quality, the aforementioned scroll wheel sticks out from the case and may be damaged if the player is dropped or compressed (if, say, you carry it in your pocket a lot as I did). So far, those issues have not been enough to convince me to replace the player (a silicone rubber cover helped somewhat), but I wouldn't buy the same model again if it died- though I would likely buy from Sansa again, as this was their first entry into the mainstream MP3 player market and their product line has improved since it was released. Go with one of the newer Sansa models if you can."

Libraries make them available to readers for a few weeks and   when the time passes the reader's license expires.  No fees, no lost items, no trips to the library in inclement weather. Ipod does not have the ability to download these items - some money issue is my guess - and when my library subscribed to two of the eaudiobook providers (Netlibrary and Overdrive) I, grudgingly, had to purchase a new MP3 player.  I've had my SanDisk for about three years now and have used it, mostly for book listening, but also for music and occasional downloaded photo display, almost constantly.  I wore out a few earpieces, including a Bose one (don't get me started on that subject), dropped it numerous times and generally mistreated it in every way short of washing it in the washing machine.  Why only four stars?  For the past week I can only listen to it with one ear.  (It's not the ear phones, I checked.)

It doesn't come with an external charger, it's slower to respond than a nano, and it's a little more difficult to navigate. And it won't play M4A files. However, it's also $80 cheaper, and it has a few great features that the Nano doesn't - like the ability to act as a voice recorder (the mic is built in and records good quality sound) that saves your recordings as mp3s. It also has an fm tuner that does a good job of picking up stations. And yes, you can record the radio directly. I wouldn't call this gadget an iPod killer. You can't use it with iTunes. But for the price, it's great -AND- it's expandable. You can use a 4gb micro SD card to expand it to 8gb of storage. The other BONUS about it is that the accessories (wall charger, car charger, leather case, etc..) can be had for cheap here on Amazon. I outfitted mine nicely (leather case, chargers, etc) for about $15. Nano accessories are just plain expensive. Of course, you can't really get full functionality out of this on a mac - you can load songs, but not movies or pictures. But it will play your MP3s, sound great and not break the bank.

I had to reboot my computer twice to get it to work right and sometimes the songs did not sync onto it even though WMP said it did.  I should have listened to the people here before I bought it.  But I was hard headed and bought it anyway inspite of what people said.  I thought what they said would not happen to me, c'mon what are the odds.  Bad move.  When there are over 30 bad reviews on a product take the warning.  I will never buy anything Apple but I must confess that the Apple Ipod is a sturdy good product.  I'll try Sony now."

The slightest pressure on the earphone plug will cause the solder to break loose from the circuit board causing music to only play through one ear.  Why would any company in its right mind rely soley on solder to hold an earphone plug in place (and a small amount of solder at that).  Lesson learned.  What a waste of my money.

I never use the movie or pictures functions, it's a waste on a tiny screen. I use the AM/FM sometimes, and the main advantage is the file formats it supports as opposed to the limited iPod. In addition, you can pull all your music back off the player, if you have recently wiped/reinstalled your computer and lost your collection. It's a handy backup."

If I had the choice agian I'd buy it again. CONS: The little round thing to use to select different things. PROS: Everything but that little round button, the brightness of the screen, the sound, the size, the SD expansion slot is a huge plus, since I can turn my 4gb player into a 10gb player for a hell of a lot cheaper then buying a 10gb player. Going to buy another one for my wife."

Download an audio book to your desktop and then to your mp3 player. After 2 weeks the book disappears. The problem, it doesn't work with ipod. So I bought the e260. It works flawlessly with the free software downloaded from the library. No more trips to the library to borrow tapes or cds and no more ""OOOWW, I forgot to return that book last month."" Although the capacity of the e260 mhas not been a problem, I wish that it came in 8 0r 16 gig flavors."
527683,A1YL8S5ZOA27KR,0,1,557,B000ETVKHE,1/28/2008,4,1,1,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I purchased this unit as a Refurb, since it cost $20 less than new and carried the same warranty. I wanted a flash drive player rather than a mini hard drive because there's less chance of mechanical failure. I use it primarily as a music player while traveling, rather than for pictures or video. The e200 was up and running in just a few minutes, with barely a need for the manual. (Actually, there is no manual; it comes on the CD.) The sound is great, even with inexpensive headphones. The screen display quality is good. It feels solid and secure. I've had trouble filling up 4GB of storage, but it's nice to know the unit is expandable via an add-on chip. The four buttons surrounding the Select button are pretty small and require real concentration to operate. These allow you to pause/go forward/go backward/change menus. But all players have some minor failing. I use USB to recharge the battery, though will probably buy one of the many inexpensive AC chargers now available. I would rate the e200 at 5 stars except that it might have some fault so far undiscovered. My first player was a Creative 256k model. The sound and features of the SanDisk are far superior."

It is a very stylish and great sounding mp3 player with expansion capabilities.  I also like the fact that you can delete a song directly without connecting to the PC - I wish my Ipod would do that.

The only negative thing is the volume only has a high or normal setting. The volume needs a variable adjustment. This is a good alternative to the expensive MP3 players.
527679,A2DH080BYL56LT,0,1,553,B000ETVKHE,1/4/2008,5,1,1,Excellent MP3 Player at a Great Value,"I started out with a cheap USB-built-in MP3 player but quickly switched to the SanDisk Sansa c240 - which was a great deal. I quickly fell in love with the Sansa brand and as soon as I saw this go on sale I snatched one up. It's got a great interface and it's designed for use with Rhapsody - a major plus. Pros: - Simple, easy-to-use interface - Great look - FM Tuner - Voice recorder - Rhapsody - Video capability (minimal as it is) - Expandability (via MicroSD) - Pricetag (when on sale and on Amazon) Cons: - Small amount of storage (though ample for the average person) - No way to charge without connecting to a computer And that's about it for the cons. Next I'm getting a Sansa View...eventually."
527678,AJZPT3U2301R3,0,1,552,B000ETVKHE,1/4/2008,5,1,1,I Like It,"In my house we have several music players including an iPod Nano 3G.  I've used RealPlayer/Rhapsody and iTunes so I know what I'm talking about.  The Sansa is a nice piece of equipment.  Size-wise it's about like a Nano 2G but thicker and a little heavier.  The scroll wheel is mechanical but does work pretty well. The interface is well laid out similar to the iPod.  The screen is is beautiful.  The included software comes with a small application to convert video and send to the player.  This makes it easy to drop in TV shows, etc. Now here's the rub, integration with services like Rhapsody aren't very polished and can cause some frustration.  Sometimes it just doesn't synchronize properly but I think the real problem lies in Rhapsody.  I've had similarly frustrating things happen in iTunes so I call this a draw. You can access the device in two ways from your PC: mass storage mode or via an app like Real Player/Rhapsody.  mass storage makes it easy to just drag and drop in your MP3s. Considering the prices you can get this thing for, I highly recommend it even over the iPod.  Apple is way too ""closed"" in terms of interoperability anyway. Update: Now that I've had this unit for a while I've noticed a defect. The mechanical scroll wheel is acting up. As you scroll in one direction it actually makes the ""cursor"" hop around in both directions making it extremely difficult to navigate where you want. Any worse and it may be useless.  I understand that SanDisk has release a newer model and it appears to have a revamped scroll wheel."

I looked at several different models and like that fact that you could add memory to this one. It is so easy to add music to.  Within minutes we added music and were ready to go.  She also added pictures, not all of them turned out well, but found that she needed to convert them first.  She will be working on that today.  The ones that were added look very nice. I have an IPOD and it is not as user friendly or as easy to add music too.  It is defineatly more work to get what you want on it.  I would recommend this to anyone getting an MP3 player!

The player itself seems to do what it's described to do based on limited play time this Christmas morning.

In short, DON'T allow it to sync with your computer or it will upload everything in your Windows Media Player library."

The item is nice and small (and easy to use as well - just make sure you take the time to read the instructions; they're a real help).  Once I got everything under way, it was a snap to load what I wanted into it.  The features are great, and I especially like the built-in FM tuner with recording device...double bonus!  As for the charging, I have noticed some folks complain about it...actually, you don't need a lap top computer...you can just get a plug in charger for it (it's made by Macally and works great - it comes with the UBS cable that connects the mp3 player to the plug)."
527673,A3HJGWV3E5U502,0,1,547,B000ETVKHE,11/12/2007,4,1,1,Good alternative to Apple,"Apple products are too expensive (and price controlled), $100 is plenty to spend on one of these.  The Sansa does a great job for that price.  The FM radio is terrific, and I can hit the record button if I am going to miss something on NPR.  With WMP I have no trouble downloading podcasts I got from ITunes. The sound from the mp3 player is impressive as well.  I don't use the video or picture function as the screen is too small for me.  I would only ask that Sansa include a wall charger, as I am not always with my computer.  I use my Koss porta-pro headphones, they are a good match. To sum it up, a well made useful product at a reasonable price."

We typically have three, but we bought this one to replace one with a broken face.  The price of $89 was unbeatable.  (Note, I do not recommend the Best Buy-Rhapsody model having an ""R"" designation unless you plan to use Rhapsody.)  The manual is cryptic, so you may have some trial and error at first.  It works well with Media Player 10 and 11 (with a firmware update-for some).  I set Media player to manual syncronization so I can sync with more than one computer.  We bought the leather case this time to protect the face and it works well.  It's good to have an FM tuner (missing on most players)."

527669,ALR7S6DB5ZKBE,0,1,543,B000ETVKHE,10/24/2007,4,1,1,Definitely need a bigger one,"I bought this to replace my cd player after scratching numerous cds on my way to work or over difficult terrain. while anyone with any technological know how will be instantly able to operate this device, it can be a little difficult to understand...for example I've tried uploading several of the same type of videos and it only uploaded one. The failed files have no reason other than files failed....okay wierd. If you put all of your files onto the usb drive side and not the mp3 player side the device refreshes everytime it's either unplugged from your computer or everytime it's turned on it will refresh the device also if said music is uploaded to the usb drive side the device will freeze and you have to go through the whole unscrew all 4 screws and remove the battery. Plus you have the option of setting yer own equalizer option but if it's putting out too much volume one speaker of your headphones will shut off...as time goes on it will become quicker and more frequent. I'm hoping they offer some support when i talk to one of the technical support people but they do offere free firmware updates...when they're available. The software inside the device automatically makes your music compatabile with the device as it's burning takes about 30 minutes for filling up the full drive just don't try to upload it to the usb drive side because half of your music won't be compatabile. It'd be nice as well to be able to gt back to the last song you were playing if the song wasn't playing but that's not possible the only way to resume the song that's actually playing is to keep it playing as you wander through the rest of the device. In all truth there could have been more buttons but if you shut off the device while a song is playing it does actually resume it. all in all it's not bad but i expected better./"

The price was, and still is, a bargain compared to the other comparable players on the market. The player has performed flawlessly. I used MS Media Player to rip CDs and load them on the e260, I have also ""dragged and dropped"" existing MP3 music files to the player. Creating playlists and syncing to the player works well, but be sure to follow the directions in the user guide. The whole process could not be simpler. I have not tried to download any files from Rhapsody...this might be more difficult. Operation of the player is simple and intuitive. Also, the battery life is really great - took it on a twelve hour flight and did not have to worry about the battery dying during the trip. Fit and finish of the unit is good.

When I first opened the box and started playing around with the player, it froze-up on me.  I unscrewed the back plate (4 very small screws) and took the battery out and put it back in after a couple seconds.  It has worked great since then. I really like the light-up scrolling wheel and the numerous ways to find songs. The FM radio feature is awesome as well. Overall, a really good product for a fraction of the price of an iPod.  I really could not see spending the extra money for anything else. I also purchased the silicone cover and highly recommend this added protection."

527660,A2FQSVYTCSGV0M,0,0,534,B000ETVKHE,8/10/2007,4,1,1,Convenient mp3 player,"I would recommend this mp3 player to those who like to listen to music while jogging or exercising. It's small, very light, and comes with a handy lanyard (for some reason I hate the armband straps). Since the machine doesn't use a hard drive, it doesn't skip like hard drive players do when shaken around. The downside to using a memory card of course is access speed - it takes a bit of time after downloading new music for it to hash through all the new files, and accessing humongous playlists can take some time (a list with around 100 songs takes 5 - 10 seconds to load). Usually I just open up a large playlist and let the player shuffle through the songs. Choosing a song through a large playlist is a pain, since the machine is slow when scrolling. For a ""serious"" mp3 player I would rather recommend something like the iRiver, but if you're just using it for exercise etc. this one's great. It's a great replacement for the iPod Shuffle in my opinion."

Loading songs using drag and drop and syncing it with the Windows Media Player is easy for any experienced PC user.  It comes with a free trial for the Rhapsody music service, but it doesn't force anything on you.  I found that I liked Rhapsody quite a bit though, so I might stay with it after the trial. Picture quality was fine for a device of this type.  I had no problem reading text and videos and images didn't look too bad.  It does require you to convert image and video files before the Sanso will display them, but the Media Converter that was provided did this fairly fast and effectively. The little memory card slot comes in handy, since it allows me to add files to the player without plugging it into my PC.  It allows you a huge amount of storage since you can take quite a few of those little microSD cards with you where ever you go, and its very easy to switch them out. Overall, a great value.

Doesn't have the iPod name or advertising behind it, but much lower in price, has unlimited expandability (via MicroSD cards), FM radio and overall quality makes up for any differences to me. As for my son, he is very happy with his present and tells me that his Sansa works and sounds just as good as his friend's iPod's.  That's enough for me to say that these were excellent buys."

I use Windows Media Audio and haven't had any problems syncing the files to the player."
527644,A2JKKN67B4KONS,0,0,518,B000ETVKHE,5/6/2007,4,1,1,Great player for the money,"For the price this cannot be beat.  Here is the line up of MP3 playing devices I have or tried, ipod shuffle 2nd gen, PSP, Dell Axim x51v, Iaudio U3, sony NW-E003F, Sony NW-S705F, Rio Carbon, Rio CE2100, Zen Vision M, Rio Forge.  My favorite is the Creative Vision:M, but for the price the Sandisk is not a bad player. First off the prices have comes way down on flash players.  I bought this one for 120.00, but around the same time I probably could have gotten the 6GB for just a little more.  That is crazy. The design is nice and sleek.  It is black has a pretty scrach resistant plastic front face, a metal back with the ability to remove the battery.  There is a physical jog dial that you spin which is very unique.  I would say that the player is closest in style to the Samsung YP-t9.  The T9 is about 40 dollars more and the differences are that it is considerably lighter (no metal on the unit at all) and the interface is all flash based (and runs a little slow).  To me the players are interchangable (the asian version of the TP had bluetooth that they pulled when it came to the states.) The sound quality is pretty good, it plays movies well, the interface is easy to pick up and use, the FM tuner picks up all the stations in my area.  Plus as a bonus it has an expandable MicroSD slot.  You can usually find those for pretty cheap nowadays.  I would definately recommend this over the Ipod nano just for price, screen size, FM tuner, movie playback, expandability, and removable battery. Just a note you can only play music from the MicroSD card if you choose to use this option you will not be able to play movies or view pictures from it."

I have expirienced some problem with using the software program Rapsody but I think it is my problem not that of the program. I don't know if it is just me but I am not able to transfer music from Sony Sonic Stage. Probably another issue with my learning curve.

Its much easier to use than the IPOD with its proprietory music format and data transfer modes. The only complaint I have is that Sandisk does not provide a free USB power charger with it. This is a huge hindrance when travelling, and you'd need to buy one from the market. Its price should be discounted for when comparing with other players."

The MP3 player built in also enjoyed my moments while traveling. But, everyone's preference are all different so check out other  electronics as well. Pro's: When I first purchased the sansa e260 for $[...], there was a defect    so I contacted the Amazon customer service and there customer service responded to all my messages and were really supportive. This Sansa e260 has 4GB  which has 1.8 movie screen , voice recorder, MP3 player, FM radio, and picture storage. At a price of $[...] is not bad compared to those who are also trying to purchase a voice recorder with mp3 player, and movie player altogether. The transfering of music files was really simple using the Windows media player -> sync. It took about 1 sec for each song to get transfered. Con's: The movie really does not take up the whole 1.8 screen size. (Unless I don't know of some program that would allow you to watch the movie that covers the whole screen.) Thus, the subtitles were too small to read and I had to watch the movie up close. The transfering compared to a songs really took a long time (it might depend on the size). The Sansa came with this black thin cover which still makes it flimsy. The other supplied items that the Sansa came with were one USB wire that charges the Sansa, ear phones, line strap, and a CD that you need only to transfere movie files. All in all, I guarentee this SANSA E260 $[...] is worth the amount to purchase. But, again everyone might want more storage space, or a bigger screen size."

I had previously owned a Rio Sport and a Dell DJ Ditty.  I was tired of the ""disposable"" feel to both of these; I did not, however, want to invest in an Ipod Nano or Video Ipod.  The Sansa was a great alternative to both of these. The size is great, it is very small and the screen is crystal clear.  I have not yet downloaded movies to it, but I have downloaded pictures and it really couldn't be easier.  The price on this is reasonable for the stylish design and the features.  It is really a great looking player.  The sound quality is good on most of my music...there are only a few tracks that the volume needs to be up a little louder, but this could also be because they are copied tracks. You cannot make multiple playlists, only one ""GO List"", but otherwise navigating your music is super easy. The case it comes with is really nothing more than a felt envelope, so be prepared to buy a case of some sort, but that really is the only thing that I have to say on the negative front. My 15 year old son saw it and loved the look and features, so we will be buying another one for him. Great, affordable MP3 with a stylish look!"

It does everything you would expect of an MP3 player plus it also has video capability, an FM radio, and can be a voice recorder. All in a very small package. I especially like the Windows interface for depositing songs onto the MP3 player. Rip the song with your favorite software and then simply drag -and-drop it onto your player, it is that easy. I would use this method and avoid the MP3 software that comes with the player. I found it cumbersome and non-intuitive."

Tried all settings, but when it would shut off (sometimes after only a few minutes, other times after 15 or so), we'd need to reconnect it to the PC to get it to even turn back on.  Went through phone-assistance (someone with limited english speaking abilities) and they finally decided it was a faulty unit. The 2nd MP3 player has worked great and is easy for my 12 year old to manipulate, load, use, etc.  He's very pleased (bought new headphones for it tho...the ear buds fall out and are pretty flimsy)."

527630,AV37E7236PJ5V,0,0,504,B000ETVKHE,1/25/2007,5,1,1,Good Buy,"I did alot of research before buying an MP3 player, and came down to either an iPod, or the Sansa.  After comparing features, I decided to buy the Sansa. The price of the Sansas (especially on Amazon) was cheaper than the iPods, and it included some nice features, like a built in FM radio.  I especially like the expansion slot.  This MP3 player can even record from FM, or just voice.  And it plays videos too. Also nice, is the fact that you can use several different subscription services, unlike iPods that tie you to iTunes exclusively. It's pretty easy to use, although the instruction manual leaves a little to be desired.  I can have Windows Media Player take care of syncronizing the player to my media, or I can simply drag and drop the MP3 files myself. For pictures and video, you have to use the Sansa Converter software to download to the player, even if the file is in the correct format, which is a bit of a drag.  But I won't be using the player for videos: personally, the screen is just way too small for me. I have not had problems with the player locking up, as other reviewers had.  I did get errors when I would connect the player, but connecting the player directly to the computer, instead of through a USB hub fixed that problem.  My computer is a frankenstein, so that may be the cause, since Sansa says you can use the player on a hub. The only other downside, was that I did not find the earbuds comfortable.  They seemed to be too big for my ears.  But, I have quite a few earbuds around, so that wasn't a very big downside for me. All in all, I would recommend the Sansa."

His previous MP3 (an iriver 5 gb H10) died  more times than I could count. He wanted an ipod, but I refuse to give into the whole craze over a player that's over-priced and over-hyped. The Sandisk looks cool, it's small, has great sound, had a ton of features (many of which he's still learning to use), and is a great deal! It offers so much more than an ipod at a much better price point. Hey, if a 16 year old is impressed with it, that say it all for me. I might even buy one for myself because he gifted his H10 to me. Gee...thanks."

It has a few downsides; but if you can live with them....then don't think about other players. what I found to be ok....: - price/Gb is the best - all features...8+ - portability - resistance (dropped it a few times) - battery time is ok (but only when used as a mp3 player) what was annoying: - my hand is not that large...but the buttons do not fit at all anywhere(and one of them was hard to press...) - charge every time I plug it ?!?!?!?! that's a good battery killer :D - the screen scratches quite fast (after 2 months it has a reasonable amounts of scratching, but visible only in certain angles) - it hangs/is slow from time to time, if at full capacity... - some mp3 are totally crashing it....don't know why....:( - playing only songs in a directory is IMPOSSIBLE....why???? - the application is too simple...little features What I would like: instead of the voice recorder, a simple text viewer... :D"

I did a lot of research before committing to an MP3 player, and this one had the right blend of features. I love the screen, it's got plenty of memory, and it's very easy to sync with Rhapsody and Media Player. I bought the travel kit, too, which I also like, except that with the leather cover on, it's a bit harder to operate the buttons. I also wasn't crazy about the ear buds. They are not comfortbale to wear for long periods, and I found them too loud for my liking (when I have something inside my ears, as opposed to an over the ear headphone, I like it very low). I just use a different set of headphones. One last note: one reason I bought this was to store digital pictures while on vacation. That does not work. You can store pictures on this device, and you can even use it like a flash drive, but you can't import pictures directly from your camera and view them on the screen. That's a rather unusual use for an MP3 player anyway, but I thought I'd mention it just in case. Overall, it's a great product and I think SanDisk did a phenomenal job with it."

I felt it was a viable, less expensive alternative to the iPod and don't regret that decision.  I added better earphones and a Boxwave charger, which is a nice alternative to using the computer to recharge it. I've also added the 2GB SD memory card which unfortunately significantly slows down the startup of the Sansa.  Without the SD card, it takes 10-15 seconds for the Sansa to start playing.  With the card, each time you turn the Sansa on it ""refreshes the database.""  It now takes about a minute 15 seconds for the Sansa to start playing on mine with about 1.5GB of music files on the SD card. For the price of the 2GB SD card, I could have bought the 8GB Sansa and had more memory and avoided this hassle.  I wish I had done that."

I like the 4GB memory and Lithium battery in this player, but there are several aspects that are not so good compared to the older model. Pros: 1. No need to buy batteries or recharge AAA batteries 2. 4GB memory size is very useful 3. Volume control is easier as you can rotate it clock/anticlock wise while holding the player at any angle. 4. The video play capability is nice (I tried to watch a video while working out), although it is not convenient to watch on such a small screen. Cons: 1. Buttons are hard and not so convenient (SDMX1 had the best controls I have ever seen in audio players). 2. The charger/sync cable is propriatory 3.

All of my friends owned Ipods, but I decided to do some research before I committed myself to a particular product.  After reading hundreds upon hundreds of reviews (I'm rather picky~), I settled on the Sansa e260.   It was a great decision on my part. I have had my Sansa for four months now. It is small and light though solid in design.  The light up wheel is wonderful and rather easy to utilize.  The colored screen is very clear and I have no problems reading or navigating through it.  And who can't help but enjoy the amount of memory for the price?  Sansa's also go on sell throughout the year so it's good to keep an eye out for the deals. The music that is produced by this wee music machine is beautiful and truly sounds great.  How such remarkable clarity of sound can emerge from such a tiny contraption is beyond me, but I'm thankful for it! This is, hands down, the best on the market. There are only a couple gripes from me. I still have yet to find a way to make adequate play lists other than using the ""To Go"" list for my music.  Also, the Sansa came with those cheapy ear buds (as all the mp3 players unfortunately do).  Since I have sensitive ears, I was getting earaches from using the ear buds and they also kept slipping out of my ears so I went to Circuit City and got a pair of head phones that clipped over my ears.  They were only ten dollars and even have adjustable volume control on them.  No more ear aches and no slipping = wonderful! On another positive product note, I bought one of those Action Jackets by DLO and it is perfect when I go running.  I always keep my Sansa in the jacket and it is great protection for my little music maker.  The Sansa e260 is wonderful.  After checking the manufacturer's website, I saw that there will be more accessories coming out (hopefully soon).  I can't wait to get a car transmitter for it :-) 5 stars all the way from me and two happy thumbs up."

CONS: i had some trouble figuring out how transfer video... supporting documentation for this device is absolutely terrible.  even the configuration dialogs are sub-par. although customer support agents attempted to be helpful, the 3 i spoke to had very thick asian accents and their working knowledge of the product was very limited.  so not only was there a slight language barrier, they couldn't help me with either of my two problems. somewhere along the line two of my playlists were duplicated (title only).  i think it had something to do with switching from ""Plays for sure"" and ""Rhapsody"" modes.  i had to ultimately edit a .toc file and delete some files from a hidden system file on the player. the buttons surrounding the scroll wheel are too far under the scroll wheel to be pressed with the blunt of my fingers so i have to use my finger nails.  this would be alleviated with either a lowered scroll wheel , enlarged buttons, or buttons that required less pressure to press. as expected with such an immature product, there isn't a very large array of accessories to choose from.  this is probably just a matter of time. can't delete playlists from player. (as might only be a problem in the case where playlists were duplicated and the duplicated playlists showed up on the player only; rhapsody showed only one copy) *****PROS***** a beautiful graphical interface.  the icons and navigation are very well designed. F.M. tuner!! i have a speaker set plugged into my laptop and now i can just move the audio plug into my sansa and listen to F.M. while browsing the internet.  and sometimes you just don't want to listen to mp3's.  the reception is as clear as could be and you can set presets and change them with a click of the center button.  another benefit is the recording feature. you can record clips of F.M. broadcasts. expansion slot!! where is apple with this?! this was a huge selling point with me.  if i ever run out of space, i can purchase one of the several different size microsd flash cards. FAT file system (USB flash drive-type).  another huge selling point for me.  i like that i can add files through windows explorer. photo and video support. on a scale of 1-10, i would give the video and photo playback and support a 7.  the video looked great and i personally didn't need a full-featured video player.  but the reproduction is great. external appearance.  i like the smooth black surface and solid metal scratch-resistant backside. user changeable rechargeable battery. it's not an apple. when comparing an IPOD and Sansa there is just no question.  almost every aspect of the Sansa is better."

He paid almost $100 more too! The video picture quality is amazing, and the sound quality is no different.

I have large hands/fingers. Proprietary Charger. Should be standard mini-usb. We purchased this on 12/26/06 for my wife.

P.s if there are defects like most new products get a warranty it works wonders.
527611,A3TR1A0R9IIM8N,0,0,485,B000ETVKHE,10/27/2006,4,1,1,Very Good but could be better....,"I bought this player a month ago to listen to ebooks downloaded from Netlibrary.  It is very easy to get the file on to the player and listen to it.  It has a resume feature where you pause the player and turn it off and when you turn it back on it remembers where you are in the book.  Very nice!!  However, because of my fat fingers I sometimes hit the wrong buttons and lose my place.  Then it is a royal pain to fast forward to the spot in my book.  It can take 15-20 minutes to fast forward 10 hours in a file and then it can be tricky to get it to stop in the right place.  I contacted sandisk about getting the fast forward to have the abilitiy to go really fast forward if you hold the button down for a certain amount of time.  Something like jumping ahead an hour instead of 20 second increments like it does now.  They said they would think about it.  I am looking for something else.  In the meantime if I lose my space over 10 hours in or longer I listen from my laptop so I don't have to get frustrated sitting with a slow fast forward.  Just thought I would share this with other audio book lovers looking for something to use.  I am considering a pocket pc instead which has a mobile version of windows medio player and I can use the seek bar and slide to my spot in the file in 10 seconds.  No resume though in those pocket pc from what I hear. May 2008.  There is a happy ending to this story.  I found an mp3 player with a slide bar.  It is a Cowon D2 and I love it.  Been using it for the past 5 months and it works great for Netlibrary books.  I highly recommend it for this application.  The 2 gb size is plenty big for books, but you can get one with more memory.  It has bookmarking and the few times I forgot to bookmark, I was able to click on the slide bar and I was back to my spot in the book.  The battery life is phenomenal.  Don't need a recharge for the life of a book and then some.  Comes with ac power adapter so can recharge very quickly."

It's very small so if you lose things easily, this may not be the right player for you.  However, it has so many capabilities.  I love that it has the FM tuner on it along with videos.  It took me a while to figure out how to download the music onto it, but once I figured it out I was impressed.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I bought a car adapter with it and listen to it in the car.  This player is great and I'm glad I got it over the ipod."

I use MP3 players mostly for Text To Speech books while I walk.  These text to speech books playtimes can be 15 hours and longer.  THe problem with the E200 series players is a poor implementation of the scan and fast forward features. Fast forward functions at one speed and takes approximately 5 minutes to advance 1 hour into the file.  The scan feature using the thumb wheel to  essentially to queue the file to a specific spot, but for large files it takes 3 to 4 minutes to advance an hour. Also there is no bookmarking where you are in a file, so if you are listening to a large file and decide to catch to latest news on the radio, you then will start at the beginning of the file.  Back to the fast forward or scanning the file to get where you left off. Also related to this same issue is that if you are playing file and inadvertently enter ther main menu then again start the file fromj the beginning. With this drawback I still feel the player overall is a strong completer in its class."

( ive dropped it 4 times on the floor without busting. 2.It has a big screen for viewing photos, videos, album art and other info 3. the video is amazing. it has very good contrast and has good sound and easy to upload 4. the photo's look much clearer than other photo mp3's( Ipods) 5. The player has so much memory that i can't get it full. 6. it has expandable memory which is a plus. 7. its not an ipod. what person would want an mp3 like that junk. 8. great control and well placed buttons I suggest going out and getting one yourself. because this is one great mp3"

The trickiest thing is clearing off all the other music you don't want. If you want a fresh start then I would recommend formatting your sansa through the ""my computer"" window."

It worked fine for awhile. My only other complaint was that the circular dial, for scrolling thru menus, songs, etc., gets in the way of pushing any of the 4 small buttons just outside the dial (see pics). Recently, however, the player began acting funny. I had not made any additions or changes, that I know of. When certain menu selections were made, the screen would freeze and then the device would reset itself. This happened over and over again for almost any final menu selection. I deleted all the media content, but the problem persisted. I also tried to upgrade the firmware, but I could not switch to the correct USB mode due to the device resetting itself each time I made the selection. TJM"

This player has a lot of memory and is a sleek looking unit. It is substantially less expensive than the IPods which seemed to be overpriced. This MP3 player is also very easy to use. The only problem I'm encountering with this series is finding accessories. The docking station for this MP3 series hasn't hit the market yet and will not be available until January 2007.

The player itself was manufactured in 2006 and still being sold as new by Amazon and JR's Computer world. The product information fails to leave out the fact that you can only use a 2gb mirco sd card, it will not recognize anything else. So forget about SDHC compatibility. Speaking of compatibility you can not hear audible.com book content on it and will never be able to. If you want album art you have to find it on the internet and install it manually in each album folder (big pain). Most players will automatically do this when you sync with windows media player or your preferred download service. Now to continue the nightmare I went on the Sansa site to try to fix all the stuff that is not compatible with the rest of the world and it was listed as a ""retired player"" So you can forget about any support. I just bought nothing more than the electronic version of a gallon of outdated, rotten milk."
527599,A23J14VVT9DHK8,0,0,473,B000ETVKHE,12/27/2006,4,5,7,First mp3 player....,"Only had my e260r since 12/25. I'm fairly new to the whole MP3 generation, but I am quite handy w/electronic devices, and pretty computer saavy. My wife got this for me for X-MAS. I simply indicated I wanted an MP3 and this is what she got. Its primary use is for the GYM, shopping,and awkward ""waiting"" moments. I also am a recording artist(in my spare time) and wanted to carry around all my music minus all the ""cd's"" (I'd have to have my friends come out to the car to hear my new songs!!, or bring the CD's where ever I go.) Anyway, wifey did quite a bit of research and did alot of comparing different products, and ended up w/this.  Frankly, she doesnt know a thing about iPODs, or MP3 players, but after getting some bestbuy tech help, and advice , she did pretty well. Overall, I am somewhat impressed. I've toyed w/friend iPODs, etc...before and wasnt overly enthused about theirs. I've only got to use it a couple of times. I was eager to downlaod ""my"" songs to it. I initially had to trial and error. I wasnt happy that I had to utilize ""their"" programs to transfer files. I think all iPODS,MP3's should work universally w/any audio/video/pic file on your pc. USB & GO! Not quite that easy. SO, Once downloading their musicstore/media programs ie. firmware(that comes with it)... the FILE transferring was very quick. It took a little while to figure out initially, but once you've got it, its a breeze.  (Just Click file from any program(iTUNES,WindowsMedia) and drag it to the playlist group you desire.(using their program)Songs Xfr's in about 1.5 secs! I havent done any videos, or pics yet, so no input there. PROS: Comes w/Tons of music already in it. Plays music, videos, pics/slideshows, FM radio, Recording feature. Screen is crystal clear/vibrant color. Very small/compact!(for me, the smaller the better)Sound is decent. CONS: DIAL/wheel IS SURPRISINGLY plastic!? & seems flimsy.  It gives it a ""cheap"" feel.(I was impressed w/the touch sensativity of the ""iPOD"" wheel and just spinning your finger round the dial(thats was cool),cool isnt always better. Sometimes I'D PRESS TOO HARD OR NOT HARD ENOUGH ON THE the iPOD it would go to far...etc Anyway, It's alot better when its dim and the wheel is lighted up blue. But the wheel seems at first glance a ""turn off"". It will grow on you in no time. It serves it purpose and no complaints about its effectiveness. So that will go away. ( I like leather not cloth, Air Jordans not reg b-ball sneaks.- point is: I have pricey ""taste"", so dont let that deter you) Next, Buttons are too small for my liking. I have to press a button sometimes 2-3 times for it to take, Or use the tip of my finger/fingernail! I'm 6'1 w/pretty big hands. The buttons are (as others have said) too low compared to the height of the wheel. Hasnt really FROZEN up on me, but its had minimal use. NEXT, I've read that you cannot ""create"" your own ""playlist"" but I've yet to really research it. I just add songs to a pre-determined playlist on it and delete any songs I dont desire. Not sure if any MP3's can do this, but you cannot delete songs manually using the player. It has to be done using the computer program. (At least I think so) womp-womp. NEXT, Doesnt come w/AC adapter!?!?!? What if i have no access to a computer(traveling) etc?? earphones are OK, but seem to be a bit wide to fit inside my ear? OVERALL: I've still gotta invest some more hours into it before giving it my best opinion.(havent tried video OR pics yet) For now.. It's GERAT! Not too complicated to use. Many great features. Great SCREEN QUALITY.  Good memory, and able to install more!. I like it and am satisfied w/it. Just that darn wheel seems so ""cheap""(NOT A BIGGY) Hope this helps.. --- I've READ MANY REVIEWS and ALOT OF THEM HELPED ME!!  PEACE!"

The first stopped working, I mailed it back to Apple, and they told me it was no longer covered by the warranty, because of external damaging to the casing (which, incidentally, happened at the beginning of our torrential but short relationship, and had minimal reference outside of this...) they had the audicity to ask me that, for it to be repaired, it would cost more than I initially bought it for. It was a 15 gig model they were no longer making. We lasted 7 months before my heart was broken. (Yes, my life is 13-17% better having direct and constant access to music) Now the second iPod I bought was a Mini, used. It was great, a complete conveniency, but once again it stopped working. This time the warranty was voided because I was not the original owner. And yes, I am nitpicking, Apple is technically (contractually) is their right, and this I grant them. But I am an individual, this was my experience with Apple was that they were providing a fix, like drugging their customers to get them hooked, let 'em keep coming back for more. They came upon and then cornered a market in the neccessary progression aurally (like the first makers of CDs or DVDs while everyone else is tapes and VHS) and, as far as customer service, and their side of the transaction, they did a screw job. Now to SanDisk. This is a quality item I would endorse over the iPod according to its merit... 1) Possible to upgrade with the expansion slot 2) If the battery drops out on you (which it will, this is how consumerism is, a la cars and making a lesser quality product so the consumer will have to spend more, blahblah sick cycle) one can replace it 3) For me it really comes down to having bought 2 iPods and being treated like a number, a profit margin or a training telemarketing and phone centers to refer to section 13 sanction g) when dealing with an irrate consumer, er, customers complaints, be repetitive and condescending till they hang up; or SanDisk, which in 4 months has been no problem, CHEAPER, and better than the iPod, like an improvement, just read other reviews and you will see that this experience resembles a lot of other frustrations over this, and the bottomline is that other companies have to bend over to try and solict customers who are eating up the Apple (yeah, I know, terrible reference with the Apple, so what...). Apple + thumbs down to the power of screwjob = go ahead and be a sucker if you want to 'consume' SanDisk with a variable of whether or not I need to vent in 8 months because SanDisk did not cook my eggs right (overhard on Wednesdays) I change this review denouncing them, too, but right now I'm satisfied, eating eggs."

For a fully-loaded 1GB MicroSD card, it takes one and half minutes EXTRA to start up the device. It reads the contents in the card and rebuild the database. Can you imagine that you have to wait for almost two minutes to listen to a song in your mp3 player? Forget about cards larger than 1GB. It takes even much longer to boot. If you need more momery in the future, buy the 8GB model. It is only $50 more than the 4GB model. It costs you $60 for a 2GB MicroSD card now. With the firmware problem, don't count on using the MicroSD card for future expansion. Also the device does not support Asian languages. You will see garbage characters for songs in Chinese, Japanese. iPod does a better job than this. You will then need to load the Asian firmware from other sources. Sandisk does not gaurantee this usage. Overall, the hardware is great. The price is right. But the firmware sucks. Buy it if you don't need Asian language support and understand that MicroSD card is unusable."

Wow, this sounds like a 100% positive review so far, but trust me, it gets worse from here on out.  On both of my players, I have had to reformat and reset the software at least 3 times on each player.  Yes, this is not hard, but It is a pain to have to do basically every time you wish to upload music.

We can't seem to fill them with music, no matter how hard we try. I have not used the video option yet, but I will soon. As a side note, the one I bought my husband was also a refurb.

I contacted Sandisk, who tried several ""fixes"" to get it running again, but it was frozen and totally unusable. Since the warranty wasn't up yet, they sent a replacement. A week after the warranty expired on the replacement Sansa, it did the same thing. I spent a week trying every fix I could find online. Nothing worked. It's gone. A little research (Google ""Sansa"" ""refresh database"" and ""error"" to see what I mean) showed that Sansa MP3 players have a terrible reputation for freezing up permanently, so beware!  My brother received a Sansa for Christmas, and it died within 24 hours of him ripping off the wrapping paper. According to reviews, and asking sales reps which players get returned the most (the Sansas, they said), I recommend a Sony Walkman MP3 player instead.  Some are compatible with Rhapsody, work with audiobooks, and have a terrific sound and beautiful display for a fraction of the price of a Sansa (just buy it at Walmart... it is $30-40 cheaper than Amazon.)"

I also really like the way it downloads music so easily from my Windows Media Player.  It's a piece of cake. One thing: I don't know if I have funny-shaped ears, but the earphones are really hard to fit and keep in, and they hurt after awhile.  I don't know why they can't make better fitting, more comfortable earphones.  So I bought the JBuds ear buds, which sound great (maybe better) and are so comfortable!

BUT, WOW.  First, it is FAR superior to any ipod because with rhapsody, you sign up for the service for $15/month, but then you can listen to ANYTHING you want.  You don't have to buy or rip everything you want on your player.  Since I got rhapsody, I haven't touched my CD collection at all.  All you have to do is type in the name of an artist you want and you can put a single song, or the whole CD on your player with a simple drop and drag. No 99 cent charge!  It's unlimited!! It also has ""radio stations"" that come pre-made, or you can pick artists you like and it will play them and others who are similar at random.  It's a great way to listen to new music that you might love. Basically, this service is unlimited.  I can't believe everybody hasn't switched to this! Also, unlike an ipod, the player comes with FM radio (that you can record) -- which comes in really handy at the gym when you need it to listen to TV, or if you want the current news or whatever.  It also has a voice recorder, so you can make notes for yourself or record a lecture, or whatever.  The battery lasts 20 hours!  It's light, and since it's on flash, it's more durable than a hard-drive model. I'm in love."

If you get this player, and you really should, definetely make sure you upgrade to the latest firmware as it adds so much more functionality: custom equalizer, multiple ways to play the music (play all, play all artist, play all album, etc). I'm not really concerned about the video capabilities, but I did convert a few Divx files with the included converter software. I'm not too impressed by that though - the original files were 98Mb Divx5 and when they converted, they were 258Mb. That's a waste to me. There also doesn't seem any way to change the settings for a lower bit-rate, but I could be wrong, I didn't dive into the software much. Works GREAT with MediaMonkey, sounds great, TONS of storage and very crisp screen.

When the product arrived, there were no issues.  It was clearly marked refurbed, but was clean and looked almost like new.  I plugged it into my IBM T60, it had no trouble connecting - the trouble started when the downloads took place. All of my  music is legal.  Paid for and on my machine.  After completing the transfer, the player would not play certain songs.  The message that would come up told me to Synchronize my music to my computer.  So I tried again, and that's when I noticed that music I do not own was somehow downloaded to this player.

First the good: a ton of music can be stored and organized and works well with the Rhapsody subscription system: you are your own radio station producer!Way cool! Now the not so good: I've found this MP3 to be extremely balky when navigating between playlists and using the random/repeat options: you literally have to shut off the player and restart it if you switch from one playlist to another (UGH!) otherwise you will hear the same song over and over again: this can be frustrating when on the go especially when driving and using an FM Transmitter or jogging. But balance that annonyance with a lot of music space and a nice two hour battery and for the money you have a good value for your money.

I've dropped it countless times, gotten it wet, smashed it and otherwise abused it, and it technically still works. The Sandisk MP3 I had before that never really broke either, I was just ready to upgrade to a fancier model. I've never had a problem with the software, however, I hardly use it, most of my music can just be dragged and dropped. It has the same features as an Ipod, it even looks almost identical, but costs half as much! As long as Sandisk keeps making such high quality products, I'll keep choosing their products!"

Mine did not come with instructions or an installable program, but I figured it out anyway. It does not come with a wall charge, only a USB connector. It would be smart to go ahead and by a wall charger (and if you're a constant listener, get the car charger too). Generally, a full charge will last roughly 15 to 20 hours. Usually I can charge it and it will last at least two days with almost constant listening (course, when I'm in the car I have it charging). I read some reviews of people saying that the volume resets to 50, mine stays at what I turned if off at. The buttons are perfect for small fingered people (me). I love the ease of volume control as well as the option to put the keys on lock to prevent anything from changing if you put it in your pocket. The ear buds are your average standard ear buds (I have tiny ears so I had to buy something else that would fit). The playback has perfect sound quality, if you download music, as for CD downloads, it isn't as good will the volume capacity. I haven't used the video, voice recorder, or picture features, since I bought this specifically for music. The FM radio is good if you are in a decent area to receive a signal (where I work I can't pick up anything). Needless to say, I truly enjoy this product. I did notice that it does not hold as many songs as it says. Mine only holds about 656, but at least you can purchase a MicroSD to expand it instead of worrying about running out of room."

The first thing that I noticed is that I couldn't just drag and drop files. I had to load Rhapsody to use it for music. I couldn't listen to anything I didn't just rip to it, also Rhapsody costs to use for more than an interface. It is not easy to use nor is it very user friendly. I finally figured out how to get around the Rhapsody problem, but it is still a pain to use. Don't under any circumstances ever disconnect from your computer with out shutting the e260 down after doing so. It locks the e260 up and you will have to remove the battery to shut it down. Also even though it looks like and IPOD connect don't even try it. I had to send mine back to get fixed after doing so. Somehow it over heated the unit. I am happy with size and interface of the unit, but if you like to drag and drop files or just want something with a little less problems, look around for something elcse."

I am pretty happy about the product. The earphone is not that great I was told, but you can always find a replacement.

However, the one big drawback in my eyes with the Sansa line is the utter lack of decent docks. Other than the Altec Lansing IM413 and some ugly contraption by Timex, Sansa owners don't have much else to turn to. Furthermore, the IM413 doesn't have a clock and the Timex dock doesn't support wake-to-MP3 (no Sansas, as far as I know, have alarm functionality). This means that if you want a dock that supports wake-to-music functionality, the iPod nano is your only choice. Just FYI."

It shuts off at the slightest bump (I had to open it and tighten the battery). I freezes up constanty and now it will not turn on except for its blue ring of death. I did not abuse it because it was not in use long enough to be abused! I have had luck with several creative devices but I started using this because they do not make my favorite MP3 player anymore.

It was not the earbuds - I tried several pairs. When I googled ""sansa headphone jack problems"", I found an astonishing number of users that had the exact same problem (go ahead and google it yourself). Sansa tech support would not acknowledge this as an inherent defect and pretty much blew me off. I had just gotten the external speaker for it when this happened, and had liked the product for the most part, so I picked up another identical unit from an individual on craigslist and it worked fine for about 4 months until, guess what? THE HEADPHONE JACK DIED!  And it was the left side, exactly like the first unit.  Coincidence?  NO WAY! Not only do I have 2 units that are only worthless because of the headphone jacks, but the manufacturer is unresponsive to the problem.

Lucky me!","Just got done installing Rockbox on it and am loving it (the only real reason to get v1 over v2, at least for now). The ""easy installer"" on their site didn't work, but installing manually was a piece of cake. So basically for $40 you get a portable media player that handles pretty much any audio codec (including FLAC) with an FM radio tuner and a microphone to boot. You can uninstall it if you change your mind as well. Can't go wrong there. Just keep in mind that you can still boot up the Sandisk firmware/UI if you want to while Rockbox is in place. Another great feature with Rockbox on the e260 is that the player can read sdhc cards! You will not be able to write to an SDHC card via the USB method, but will have to get a separate card reader, load it up, THEN plug into the Rockbox'd sansa. Not much of a hassle considering the benefits. If you receive a v2, you might want to hang on to it as they are working on a port for that model. Otherwise, some like the v2 better and will trade. In any case, the refurbs are more often than not v1 still. If you don't care, perfect. You will have to buy multiple sd cards if you have a huge collection you have to take with you, as obviously this is not the highest storage capacity out there. My collection is fairly modest so I think I'll be fine (FLAC files are pretty big though). Also, the center blue ring control is more like a dial than being touch sensitive like an iPod. Therefore more moving parts. If bang for your buck is more of a concern than massive storage, then you will absolutely love this mp3 player. - Make sure to select the top USB option (MSC Mode) if you want to just drag and drop music to it without the need for any software (Watch and learn, Apple). - Enable view of hidden files and folders in XP or Vista as well (Important, google it), or you won't be able to see the all important ""music"" folder!"

527540,A34G801FR3T0MH,0,0,414,B000ETVKHE,2/8/2009,5,0,0,Great Buy!!!,"First of all I would like to say that this was probably the best mp3 player I have ever owned.  Much better than the Apple iPods.  Putting music onto the player was as easy as pie.  You can either drag and drop the file or sync it to Windows Media Player 10 or many other programs. The image quality of the pics and videos are amazing. It's almost like owning a mini HD tv.  All you have to do is drag and drop the pictures.  For videos you need to convert them into the right format.  If you buy it new, it comes with the software it won't download whole dvds. I would really only recommend this to people whose sole purpose is to use it just for music.  Personally I think it is just too much of a hassle to convert videos into the right format on any device. For parents, I think that you should consider buying this product before buying any of the iPods.  This is a great mp3 player for younger children and much less expensive to replace if it gets lost or stolen.  It is also easier to get music downloads for it as well. When I got it, I had to go and buy new headphones for it because the ones that it came with were too big for my ears though they were comfortable. I liked the fact that the player has a high volume.  I like to listen to my music at somewhere close to sonic boom and this player went above and beyond.  For the first time, I didn't have my player up at full volume.  So this is definitely something that kids would like. There is one small problem that I had with it.  When you hook it up to your computer to charge, you cannot listen to music at the same time.  I found out though that if you turn on your computer and don't log into your account, you can play music and charge at the same time.  But really.  What's the point unless you're going to hook it up to a stereo or something?  Nobody's really going to just sit there listening to music while it charges. This player is also durable.  I have sat on it, dropped it, and drowned it.  When I accidentally dropped it in a toilet, all I had to do was open it up and air it dry.  Afterwards I just screwed the back on again and it worked beautifully. So the downsides are the video converter hassles, the fact that music cannot be played while logged into your computer, and the headphones were a little too big.  The upsides were the how easy it was ot get pictures and music onto the player, the durability of it, and THE PRICE!  I'd reccomend this to any of my friends."

My only complaint with this purchase is that I did NOT get any print document on how to access and use the various functions of it.   After getting the unit to play it is a great device.

527530,A2VCCVZ3QFW0DF,0,1,404,B000ETVKHE,12/28/2008,5,0,0,SanDisk e260 review,"As far as my experiences go, loading music is fairly simple via drag and drop in Windows.  I initially attempted to manage the transfers via WinAmp 5x, but found that doing so creates some tagging quirks, such as pushing dates of albums to years like 2098 etc.  Trying to correct this tagging issue via WinAmp's Auto tag or manual adjust failed, sometimes with the PC freezing.  I recommend avoiding actual management of your e260's media library via WinAmp, playback from within WinAmp seems fine however. The player's weight and size are both comfortable. With it's metal backed case, the e260 feels solid.  The unit is not so small and light that you're afraid of losing it, nor so bulky that it couldn't be carried in a shirt pocket without feeling weighed down by. Browsing music and player features is easy via the dial navigation feature.  The display is bright and legible though text appears a bit pixelated (looks more like text is rendered as a bitmap). The supplied media management software (Sansa Media Converter by Arcsoft)seems fairly capable.  I performed a test run on a 19 Mb, 4 + minute music video in .MOV file, which the software formatted & transferred to the e260 in under 5 minutes (AMD 64 X2 Dual Core 4400 [2.31 Ghz] w/3Gb of RAM).  A downside of transferring videos to the player appears to be that the original file size will expand by %200 - %250 ie , I began the transfer process with a 19 Mb video file on the PC; the file size ballooned to 50Mb on the e260.  Too bad this one doesn't support .MP4. For the price (approx $60) and features, this is IMO a difficult player to pass:  FM tuner with presets, graphic EQ presets, Micro SD slot for added storage (not certain of maximum capacity), video playback, photo viewer,voice recording and it doubles as portable file storage. If your in the hunt for a compact MP3 player but don't want to drop the $ for an Ipod Nano, this is a nice alternative.  The e260 is also a little friendlier to navigate vs the Creative Mozaic for folks with large hands."

It is all I wanted from a player, and at an attractive price.  It appears well-made having a metal back.  From what I have seen, it is not much larger than ipods and at half the price, with the addition of an FM receiver and microphone for voice recording.  My only issue is the ear-buds which most reviews say are never very good original equip.  They have decent sound when pressed to your ear, but just sit on the outside of your ear canal offering thin sound when left alone.  I purchased another set which ""plug"" into my ear for fuller sound."

Seems to work very well but I started with trial and error to start as no manual was included with the refurb.  The SanDisk site linked to the operators manual which made things much simpler. Don't really care for REFURBISHED printed on the back but for the price I can't complain.  The recharge mentioned in other reviews can be frustrating but I purchased a reasonably priced charger.  The 110 works great but haven't tried the one in the car as yet. Would certainly recommend this product accompanied by the independent charger.
527520,A2SD1K2EAUIJ1U,0,1,394,B000ETVKHE,12/17/2008,1,0,0,"Dreadful, absolutely dreadful","The problems with this player started on day two. The software has lag issues when trying to rate a song, or add one to the 'go list' or skipping tracks on shuffle. The Shuffle...  its ghastly as well, this device has no virtual memory to keep it from playing the same songs over and over and over, I had the same tunes on it for roughly a month and never heard a few of them. Occaisionally, when plugged in, the screen would 'ghost' and freeze up, unable to turn it off you can only unscrew the back and manually take the battery out. It was probably by this improper but necessary shut off that a folder of songs were corrupted. Rogue folders simply named 'l' and 'r' started duplicating all over it, exclaiming to contain 4+ gigs of data in them apeice. They couldn't be deleted and I couldn't reformat the drive. The database is currently being refreshed, and has been for many hours without progress. The computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. It's officially dead after two months of a miserable short life. I bought this thing because it was cheap, my mistake, and I have learned from it. But also, I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the Ipod. Because I had feared the monopoly on mp3 players Apple might someday have, but after puting up with this garbage, I await the rapture. Not to say that Zune and Creative and Sony and maybe even a newer Sansa aren't worth a go, but definitely not this particular model."

I had that one for almost 2 years and really liked it. My sister had the E260 and it looked sleek and seemed nice so I bought it. It is a very nice looking player. The way the center wheel lights up is neat, although it is very tricky to work and somewhat cheap. The buttons you push to go back a song or foward a song are flush with the wheel and small. Therefore you really have to center in on them to be able to click them. Also I found I had to increase the volume quite a bit to get the player to sound good. At low volumes was a bit weak and tinny. Once you turned it high enough, the rich stereo sound came in. However, I found this volume to be too high. I used my C250 mostly when running and found it very easy to reach down on the run and change songs or adjust the volume. This was tough to do quickly w/the flush buttons. I'd have to slow down to make sure I was clicking the right button. I actually ended up returning it and ordering a new C250. I figured I loved that one, I knew how to work it and I knew it worked well. Also it was 1/2 the price!!! I have no interest in pictures or video on my mp3 player so why pay for them?"

Instead of deleting, or adding more memory, I decided to upgrade to a larger GB.  The Sandisk is a very easy item to use, especially for someone who is a computer illiterate.  I take it everywhere, and listen to it all the time.  It is not as commercialized as the the ever popular IPOD, and definitely not as expensive.  I had my first Sansa for 4 years, and have now passed it on to my preteen daughter (who LOVES it).  I would definitely look into other Sansa products if need be.  I feel they make a quality product without all the hype."

I am very happy, although there have been issues. First, I incorrectly assumed that the Rhapsody software was necessary in order to use the player. There was no information anywhere to the contrary. Not a problem, except that the software wouldn't load-- some 45 minutes wasted. Second, the text on the player was in German and couldn't be changed without help.  A call to tech support (promptly answered) led to another 38 minutes and many steps, including downloading a file from the Internet, but we installed the English text. The player interfaces with Window's explorer, but I have found that creating a play list in  Windows Media Player is more efficient, especially since you can change the order of the selections.  The sound quality, with Bose headphones, is excellent.  The FM radio works well, and allows for presets. Negotiating the menus is fairly straight forward, although expect to invest some time until you become familiar with them. Volume control is easy, and the duration of the back light is adjustable. The recorder also works well, although the sound quality is marginal. Of course, you need earphones to listen to the recording. The ""Quick Start Guide"" is not particularly helpful.  Use the help file on the CD. For the approximately $90 that I paid on Amazon, this is an excellent product. Tks to all who reviewed the player, making an informed decision easy."

It can be set to sync with the computer when it is plugged in or you can sync it manually (we prefer manually or it loads everything-pix and all).  No software included so just plug it in and go.

The expansion slot is great, since it uses MicroSD cards(very cheap!) Although apparently 2GB is the max for now... I dont really use it for video, mainly because it takes forever to encode and transfer them. The only vids I transfer are music videos. The player has a great FM radio function, which I use a lot, to find new bands to download with Rhapsody! Sound quality is amazing, and the little blue menu wheel is a lot of fun. I strongly reccomend this to anyone who is thinking about buying an Ipod Nano."

They like charging it on the computer, but I purchased the wall charger and the car charger for them, just to be safe.    It has a big screen and it is well worth the money.

(that is the only way i can see to do it) overall i recommend it. i have been using it constantly for  a month's time with no issues. the battery life is good, it does take 3 hours to charge on the usb, i guess that could be quicker. i like it"
527466,A2LZWEZJKWE7TJ,0,1,340,B000ETVKHE,6/2/2008,5,0,0,Sansa 4GB player,"I wanted a player to use with a music service like Rhapsody or URGE, found the Sansa line and I am happy to say that since purchasing the e260 I have never been disappointed.  Granted I am renting the tracks from Rhapsody but I can purchase songs from .89 to .99. I think this is a great and economical alternative to IPOD, which to tell you the truth I think is just yuppie hype.  I borrowed for several weeks my friends IPOD and found it nice to use but, it occasionally froze and sitting there transfering my CD's to the player was not only time consuming but tedious(at last count I have 450 plus albums).  I was doing just as good with my Sony Mini Disk player and got better quality sound.  And living in NYC carrying an IPOD can be a hazzard to your health. The Sansa was cheaper, has all the features of the IPOD and has an expandable memory slot with an FM radio for when you want to listen to games, news, Opie and Anthony etc.  It uses the Rhapsody Music Service which basically lets you ""rent"" songs or purchase tracks that you save to your computer or CD.  They even include album art and facts that you can print and put into your jewel cases. To this day I am still very happy with my Sansa, they only thing that is a down fall to it is a lack of good accessories.  It does not use all IPOD accessories and there seems to be a limited amount of after market accessories but hopefully with the growing popularity of Rhapsody they will start putting out stuff."

By September I already had a problem: Sometimes when I turn it on the screen turns white and I have to hold the shutdown button for 15 seconds. A few months later: 1)Every time I would try to play a video the screen would turn red and I have to hold the power button for 15 seconds. 2)When I use the voice record sometimes when I play the file it makes a really loud high-pitched sound that KILLS your ears. At the beginning of 2008 I restored my mp3 because of these problems. Here is a problem that happened after: A put a couple of videos on and a few days later I added another one. After I added that one I noticed that all the other ones were GONE. They all deleted. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! Samsung has some very good and very cool mp3 players. The P2 is touchscreen and you can connect your cell phone to it through bluetooth and answer and make calls. The S5 has a really amazing built-in speaker that is optional to use. Thanks for reading!

I have over 500 songs & 4 music videos on mine & still have over a GB of memory left, eventually I'm going to add 4 more GBs of memory & it will still cost me less than the 8GB version!

It updates music fairly easily although as a first time user it took me a while to figure out how to do this.  Some negative points were that I didn't receive an owners manual with the product, only a short tip sheet to get me start.  Also, I received the Rhapsody info sheet on music but no disk.  As for the Sansa itself, the lowest sound is pretty loud so I've had to compensate on some songs by adjusting the ear buds so it's a little quieter.  Otherwise, the Sansa itself has been a pretty cool product and I've enjoyed listing to the music."

My previous sansa was plastic and quickly disintegrated under my rough care...not so for this one.  The video screen is average but I mostly listen to long-format programs like books on tape, etc.  One big wish: that I could pause a long program, switch to music for a while or upload more, and then go back to my spot on the original program.  If I forget and charge it while paused, I'll lose my place and have to fast forward to the time (if I remember the time).  But for the price, this is a heck of a device and, with decent headphones, the audio quality for music is great. Added 4/16/08:  Today it just stopped powering up, even when plugged into USB.

The playback quality is excellent.  I have two small issues with this unit.  First I would like it to play the music in the order that I want.  The player chooses the order of the music that is played (alphabetically, random, genre).  It will not play them in the order that I want them played.  The second issue being; I would like to increase the volume.  When I plug it into my car stereo, the volume is low.  I have to increase the stereo's volume a lot to match that of CD's.  With the headphones on it is plenty loud.  These issues are not enough to keep me from recommending this unit or purchasing another in the future."

527436,A3T0L0FRY7G4Y9,0,1,310,B000ETVKHE,3/27/2008,3,0,0,Good not Great,I have the 4GB Sansa e260. It works great. The screen is bright and very easy to see. Putting music on the device is simply. You can use Media Player or just click and drag. The blue lit wheel is a very nice touch. I haven't tried the SD slot yet. I do have some problems with the device. The menu system is not very well designed. (if you really care) The radio doesn't come in so well indoors. The forward and back buttons can be hard to hit or miss hit if you have big hands. Over all it works and works good. I do recommend this if you want an alternative to the I-pod or Zune.

With the expansion slot, you can add plenty of memory in case you run out, so you don't constantly need to upgrade to a new device. Music plays pretty good on my Koss headphones (the fancy noise-cancelling kind), though it can't get as loud as my computer's system (though it gets closer than my older player). There is only one problem with this player. A very long music file (I've converted one of those relaxation CDs) will start skipping after awhile. And as for those who have had the screen freeze, I just remove the battery from the mp3 player, then put put it back in and turn the player back on. Problem solved! I think that it is a great buy for the price."

I ordered an open box version sold through Amazon's warehouse outlet. The unit came in a box that looked somewhat worn, and there was no CD with included software. The San Disk website does not offer the San Disk media converter software for download. I tried downloading it from some site that I found on the web, but the software never recognized the player when plugged into the USB port. However you don't need the software to load music or photos onto the player. I don't know if you need it for videos. Anyway the player works great and buying a refurb saved quite a bit of money."

For the money... its hard to beat. He absolutely loves the thing and has had no complaints. He tells me its one of the best gifts he's ever gotten from me. Hmmmmm.... well its obvious he's tickled pink with my selection and I'm sure anyone who buys the Sansa 260 will be as well. I also bought him a toughskin case to protect and preserve the unit and it certainly does the job quite nicely.

Microsoft says it requires a firmware update from Sandisk, but all I get from them are 'canned' responses and the like, or instructions on how to format the player, very complex instructions on MANUALLY adding album art to the player from JPEG files, etc etc, none of which has helped one little bit. I keep telling them NO, I just want it to sync as easily as music does, but all I get back is another idiobot response. I suppose the firmware will not be forthcoming because they have a whole new roster of players now and are probably not concerned with the e200 series anymore. Sound quality is good and everything but if you want a player that will properly function with WMP11 I would get a Zune or Creative."

My last player was a creative zen which wouldn't last more than a couple hours of battery life, and if you left it sit for a couple weeks the battery would die by itself.  I can leave this sitting around for months and it will still retain it's charge.  Battery lasts a long time during use too.  Seems like some allow you to connect as a MSD (mass storage device) so that you dont' have to sync with rhapsody, the one I got wasn't (which is one of my complaints).  I also don't like that there's no adapter to use this with an ipod connector (for the car).  I would think it wouldn't be hard since the connector is the same, and this unit is capable of remote control, but the pin layout is different.  I've contacted Sansa about a possible future adapter and I've gotten no response."
527414,AURQTR6LF0WYS,0,0,288,B000ETVKHE,1/29/2008,4,0,0,Great player. But you'll need to get the some extras.,"The sansa it's all about the features. Fm radio, Mp3/WMA player, video player, voice/sound/fm recorder, and more. The quality is great, so far, i've been using it for about 2 months now. The sound quality is quite good. Battery lasts about 20 hours with regular constant use. Firmware is good, but could be better. But to get the most out of your player, i recommend you get the following: * A wall outlet charger, since the sansa comes with an usb charger only (1st reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Unless you carry around a laptop everyware, or dont mind spending 2 hours in a cybercafe just to charge the player. * A protective case, unless you're very carefull with the player, it could get scratched easily (2nd reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). * Rockbox firmware. This really helps you ""get the juice"" out of the sansa player, adding great extra features such as text reader, voice operation, game boy color emulator, video/photo viewing without the need to ccompress the files, customizable skins/fonts/colors, file and folder management, text file creation, louder volume, full equalizer, bass/trebble control, and more. Besides, you can install it without uninstalling the original firmware."

I didn't realize just how great of a deal I was getting. I've owned three iPods, with my current model being the 5.5g iPod Video. The Sansa blows it out of the water when it comes to sound quality. In a side-by-side comparison, the e260 delivered a much fuller sound. As far as software, the interface leaves something to be desired. The menu system is a bit touchy when using the scroll wheel, and the file format compatibility is too lacking for my tastes. I ended up heading over to [...] and replacing the firmware. It was painless, and the instructions were very easy to follow. I now have an extremely capable and feature rich mp3 player that can now play AAC files. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent mp3 player on the cheap. I'd also highly recommend they, or their more tech-savvy friend, install Rockbox. It's definitely worth it."

But this is better than those for a number of reasons. I'm just going to break it down into pros and cons: Pros -Very similar to the iPod Nano but a lot cheaper. -The battery is easily removable. So if the battery ever dies you can easily replace it yourself. -Very durable. I never liked Nanos because I feel like if I have it in my pocket and I bang into something it could break. Also, the screen seems to resist scratches pretty well. I've used this regularly for about 6 months and the screen is still crystal clear. -Accepts Micro SD cards. -No connectivity problems/errors. I got tons of errors with the Creative Zen V. The Sansa is very user friendly. Cons -Album art has to be less than 30KB or it won't display at all. I never saw album art not show up on a Nano. -Comes with a program that will allow you to convert many different video formats to play on here. The video looks good, but the screen is so small that I feel like my eyes are bleeding when I try to watch something on here. I didn't buy this to watch video on so that doesn't really bother me. -The FM tuner is cool, but I get a lot of static when I'm listening to it while I'm jogging, which makes it kind of useless for that. -The menus are easy to navigate, but don't display some information the way I want it to (like it doesn't show the time while I'm playing a song). You can easily install a firmware replacement called Rockbox if you want to have menus that are a little more suited to your needs."
527397,A2F7CSE6KT7NI4,0,0,271,B000ETVKHE,1/11/2008,4,0,0,Sansa Rhapsody,"I have the Rhapsody version of the Sansa with the RhapsodyToGo service and I love it.  I use it for listening to music when I run and occasionally travel.  It's very easy to upload either mp3s from my local drive or subscription content from the Rhapsody interface.  Making playlists for running is very easy since you can create them in the desktop interface and copy them to the player.  The sounds is very good even with the earbuds that came with the player. The things I don't like about the Sansa have to do with the player's interface and hence my 4 star rating instead of 5.  I haven't ever found a way to stop a track from playing.  I can pause and go back to other menus but there is no stop.  It's very hard to do anything while running even something as simple as skipping a song takes two button presses -- one to wake it up and the other to skip.  I find myself having a hard time figuring out what buttons do what in various modes, for instance, controlling the music vs. controlling the menus. Overall I am very happy with my Sansa Rhapsody.  Having Rhapsody I don't really have a choice in a player, or at least didn't when I got it in 2006, so I have nothing really to compare it to.  It plays music for me when I am running and I get to pick any subscription content I want so what else do I need?  I pay $15/mo, get to listen to millions of tracks without having to pay for each one so I can choose whatever floats my boat that day for that run.  It's a runner's dream come true until there's WiMAX and I can connect directly to Rhapsody wirelessly while running!"

I've never had any other kind of MP3 player, so I don't have any experience to compare it to. Positives + It's not an iPod (will we ever escape iLife!) + Holds a TON of songs. I have 450 on there and they only take up half the space available. + Easy to navigate menu + FM stereo is great. Sometimes I just can't get away from NPR + Great video playback Negatives/ Notes - There are only two volume settings, ""normal"" and ""high."" With earbuds, normal is fine, but if you plug it in to your car or home stereo you have to turn the volume up really high on the stereo even on ""high"". - When you are playing a song or listening to the radio it doesn't show the time - You need to buy a separate AC charger, which is worth it. - The buttons are WAY easier to use with a skin on - Using Rhapsody as your primary device manager isn't the best. It often doesn't show all the songs on your device. I actually find it so annoying that I haven't taken the time to make playlists, which would really be beneficial to those with a wide range of musical interests. One thing the Samsung TY9 offers is that you can delete items from the device without a computer, which is a great feature. Some of the rarely-used extra features that I really value and if they're important to you, they're great: + FM recorder + Voice recorder + Great equalizer"

The interface is very easy to use and the graphics are pleasing to the eye. Transferring songs, video, and pictures is a breeze. I have not added a memory card as of yet. I use windows media player to copy songs, but you can drag them directly to the device also. I did seem to have trouble getting windows to recognize the player properly, but after I ran the updater I found on the Sandisk website all was well. There was a trick I found on the support forums that made windows see the player, had to do with holding down the rewind button when plugging it up, here is a link to the forum to copy and paste in your browser."

The Sansa is very easy to use, its features work perfectly, and it looks and feels really nice. You can sync the Sansa either with a software service  (I've been successful with Rhapsody, Windows Media Player, and Napster), or using a simple windows folder interface. Each works perfectly, and all the music files will be usable inside the Sansa interface. The transfers are quite fast, and judging by the amount of space I've used, this model has room for several hundreds songs. I've also downloaded podcasts and loaded them up using the folder interface. They play fine, and simply show up on the master music list under their file name. There's also a media converter for photos and video, but I have not used those features. The screen is very sharp and aids usability with a well-designed interface. The wheel and buttons on the front did take some getting used to, but now that I've been using it for a while, it seems second nature. The Sansa comes with some simple ear buds, which I can't stand. The third party earphones I purchased sound fantastic. The unit also has an FM radio integrated into it; you can switch to this by rotating the command dial to find the FM Radio menu item. I don't use it much, but it picks up a variety of radio stations near my home and work very clearly. There's a voice recorder (a ""memo thingy"") in the unit, but I can't imagine when I'd use that... The overall unit is light, and small, but not too small to handle if you have fat fingers like me. Best of all, this unit has worked 100% perfectly for me. I haven't had a single hitch, burp or failure with my Sansa. The unit comes with a USB cord that serves double duty as a charger and file transfer medium. The first charge took a long time, but subsequent use hasn't run down the battery very fast, so charge time isn't a big deal for me. However, if you intend to use an mp3 player a LOT, then the USB charge cord might become bothersome for you. It doesn't come with a very useful case, but I bought a very nice case for about ten bucks. Be careful not to buy a case that interferes with the use of the command dial or buttons. I also picked up an aftermarket retractable USB travel cord, which works fine. I looked at several different players, including Apple, before deciding on the Sansa. I'm convinced I made the right call, and I couldn't be happier with the performance of this unit. I'd recommend it unconditionally to anyone who wants a reliable unit with good features and a reasonable price."

It has had a few freezing problems but when I turned it back off and on it was fine. This device holds over a 1000 songs and gives me plenty of space for songs. I'll explain below: 1) Features on this device include music, voice recording, FM radio, and pictures. Rhapsody, Urge, or Windows Media Player can be used. Just drag and drop the songs. Holds over 1000 mp3 songs and 2000 WMA songs. You also have the option to take the CD covers and to put them on the device. I've read that movies, music videos, and TV shows can be put onto the player. 2) Sound. I can't even describe how wonderful the sound is! The sound is very crystal clear! Easy to hear! The two optional settings are Normal and High. 3) Charging. The device comes with a charger that connects to the bottom of the mp3 player to a computer USB port. It usually takes a common 2-3 hours to charge. Depends how much time has been used on the battery. 4) Buttons. The wheel on the mp3 player can be difficult at times. Sometimes it turns in the wrong direction. There is a fast-forward and rewind button....easy to use. There is also a menu/on/off button. Just press the menu button to return back to the main  menu. Hold the menu button down to turn off the device. 5) Accessories. Unfortunately, the Sansa does not come with a travel case or screen protectors. Other accessories had to be bought separately. Pros: Small, very sleek, pocket sized. Pure-quality sound Excellent color Easy-to-click buttons Rhapsody A good amount of accessories Cons: Screen freezes The wheel No wall/car charger Overall, very happy  with the device!! 5 out of 5 stars! Great buy!"

I was very happy with the ease of loading and using this device.  I did some research and asking around about MP3 players before purchasing this one and everything led me to the Sansa.  Big points that were pointed out to me were the rotating thumb wheel, the ability to add memory (although I haven't filled it yet, I do wish I would have started with the 8GB so I would have more total capacity in the future), the ability to use WMA files wich can be compressed smaller with less loss of quality than MP3, the large screen for scrolling through files, and mainly the flash memory.  It was pointed out to me by some very computer savy reletives and friends that even though you can get higher storage capacity with the hard drive based players such as I-pod, they are a mechanical form of processor with a higher probability of failure than the flash based.  All and all, I really like this little player and if the people I've talked to are right, it should last a long time.  Only fault is the lack of accesories available compared to the I-pod.  Hopefully will be coming in time."

It does take a long time to cook as all video is in .MOV (Quicktime) format. The entire E200 family is so far better than all of the C100/C200 players it's amazing. Don't even bother looking at the C series, especially if you think you might get the Sansa Base Station or about any other Dock for them.  The docks work best with the E series. The MicroSD slot is nice but it's probably cheaper to max out the built in memory now by getting the 8GB unit, which has all the same features."

The Sansa e260 promised that it would show up as a disk drive or enable synching to MediaPlayer. The instructions were sparse and I tried both methods.  This ended up in the device being so scrambled that there was no way to gain control.  It showed up as both full and empty depending on what I was trying to do (get back in control!)  I couldn't delete and I couldn't add and it hung on most operations.  Contacted support and they were quick to help.  We tried upgrading firmware, downgrading firmware, and other esoteric tricks requiring some interesing mulptiple buttons at startup.  Nothing worked and Sandisk offered to send another along.

This was my first mp3 player, so figuring out how to get the songs I wanted from my computer onto the Sansa took some time without decent instructions, and there are still some things I'd like to do that I still haven't figured out how to do.

So I did some research and thought that the E260 was the best player on Cnet.  So I got one from Wal-Mart and tried it out.  So far I like it the blue turn wheel makes it very sexy I even had friends asking me if it was a new iPod?  I told them it's just a Sansa E260 now everyone I know has one.  I also gave one to my girlfriend and she decided to buy a pink leather case while I got the black leather case.  Which I purchase from Amazon. Pros: 1.8 inch screen - Great for viewing photos/movies Turn Wheel:  Very Sexy and like the color - Matches my PC and my Blue LED Fans Buttons:  Very easy to move and it's like the iPod Nano button system Cons: Freezing:  I heard it does freeze and I had a E260 that would freeze during charging or syncing files. Firmware:  Sansa's new firmware isn't good the Song titles and artist are not space out and it looks weird Software:  Easy to convert movies/photos.  However it doesn't change gifs to moving photos when coverted to the player. Battery Charging:  Only thru the USB Cable to PC.  However I seen some off brands that will charge it thru the wall or car charger.  Also when charging you can't listen to you're songs. Accessories:  Very limited not much to buy with the player.

After I took the time to delete off all the items I would never use (sample videos, photos, and all of the Rhapsody playlists) I found I have a lot of space... 425 songs so far and still 2 gb left!  Also, once I got used to having to switch between modes and logging on to update music (which I have to do anyway to power up the battery) it's been fairly simple uploading.  Napster allows me to make playlists, I could upload CD copies from iTunes, and both can be blended by Rhapsody, so I am set.

No good stereos to adapt this to are available either. Ipod has oddles of stuff that is compatible, but not the Sansa.

BUT in all fairness I think 119.00 was a STEAL because online shopping stations were almost twice as much.It would be nice though if it came with a charger instead of the extra purchase.....Thats a bummer. That alone was almost 19.00dollars...The instructions could be alittle simplier 38 page print out!!And ear phones need to be slightly smaller or another set of earbuds added.BUT a nice mp3 would buy again.

The sound is great and with the features such as FM radio and auto shut off, video and photo storage it is fantastic. I had no trouble with transfering files all instructions were simple to follow. The screen is clear to view and the button navigation is easy to use. Also the battery charges while you are on the computer. I have never owned an Ipod so I can not compare but for the price and the extra features this sansa e260 was the best purchase for me. I would recommend this player to anyone and everyone.

It's a great alternative to the ipod at a much better price.  Some people have complained that you don't get all of the space you purchased.  Remember that the player comes pre-loaded with 20 or so songs, a video, etc.  If you delete all that then you are getting your GBs.  I love the scoll wheel but the buttons do take some getting used to.  I purchased a protective case for mine which makes them much easier to press.  It has a lot of cool features that I love-the fm radio, auto shutoff and lock feature just to name a few.  It's fairly simple to use so it would make a great gift for just about anyone."

On the negative side, the sound quality may be better than an iPod, but it's not standing up to the players from companies Cowon or iriver. Also, the interface is laggy and with some annoyances. Overall, a nice player, but I'd probably look at Cowon, iriver, Meizu, or even Samsung if I had the whole thing to do over again."

527338,A2YMA6G7V75J7M,0,0,212,B000ETVKHE,5/5/2007,5,0,0,Works perfect,"I first had a LOT of trouble getting this to be read by my computer.  I did search after search for how to fix the trouble, because I didn't want to RMA it.  So, I found lots of info, none of it worked.  Then, I had a stroke of genius, and plugged it into a different USB port (out the back of the PC instead of the front ports) and it worked!!  Another symptom of age on my soon to be replaced PC, all my trouble for 2 days was because my front USB ports don't work anymore.  So, I guess I'll throw that out there, try a different USB if all else fails. That aside, here are my comments: I like the LCD screen.  I bought the travel accessory, which I HIGHLY recommend getting.  It came with a small plastic cover to help keep the LCD screen from getting scratched.  The big travel pouch is awesome as is the snug 'leather' protector.  GET this accessory, IMO. The radio is a definite PLUS over other MP3 players, as is the price.  It gets decent reception; in my office I have a hard time getting radios to come in clearly, this works almost as good as my desk top radio (but not quite). The ear phones that it came with hurt my ears, I need a smaller, more comfortable pair. The volume control is interesting, it has a 'normal' volume and 'maximum' volume setting, and I at 1st thought that was terrible, as it didn't give much control.  But they are just MASTER volume settings, rotating the spin dial gives you actual volume control. 4GB is going to work really well for me.  Especially with the expansion slot for additional music. Using the Media converter is fine for pictures and video, and is totally not needed for music. After uploading music to the device it takes a moment to restart and update its library.  Not a big deal. Creating playlists within the device is cumbersome, but you can use your own from windows media player if you have to have playlists.  Not a big deal to me, as right now all I do is put it on Shuffle mode, and play all. I have not found any way to do any file management (such as delete) within the player itself, you have to use a computer for that. OVERALL very happy with it.  Shipping was awesome, used the free saver shipping, and it STILL came within a few days."
527337,A1T4K21I25L223,0,1,211,B000ETVKHE,5/4/2007,4,0,0,Cute Player for a Great Price,"I picked one up today after quite a bit of research.  First impressions: very light/small, very cute, felt very sturdy.  Worked right out of the box, and I didn't really need to read instructions.  The interface takes some habit forming, because for example spinning the wheel clockwise in the main menu goes up but vice versa in every other menu.  I love having the microSD expandability but hate the proprietary player/USB interface, although I guess this is expected on most mp3 players these days.  With the transfer speed of this device, I guess I shouldn't complain. When I got in my car, I couldn't get the player to work with my radio's USB interface, so I did have an encounter with Sandisk customer service.  The representative seemed to have a hard time understanding me, and I was somewhat frustrated, but she remained polite.  I ended up getting the thing working by randomly pushing my radio's buttons while on hold.  Unfortunately, I then found out that none of the Napster files would play on my car radio, although they play fine on the Sansa itself.  I don't blame Sandisk for this; Napster was the root cause of the compatibility issue.  Anyhow, the files which I could play on the car radio had good quality, and I had no other issues. Speaking of sound quality, this little device is amazing.  I can hear small sounds and detail in a song which I can't even hear on my home system.  With the flexibility of the equalizer(s), this puppy seems to have been made for a music junkie. The screen does seem to have a 3D effect, which--while nice with the photos and menus--sometimes makes me go cross-eyed.  The screen isn't ideal for videos, but that's not really why I bought this super cool mp3 player.  I watch videos on TVs. The battery life seems great so far.  I have quite a few tracks on here, with plenty of space left; I don't think most people need to carry 30GB of music at any one time.  Also, I like having the ability to do voice recordings and listen to the radio.  Switching between USB modes (to synch for subscription service) is a little annoying. I ordered a clear screen protector from a site that custom-makes them, where I also got one for my Axim.  I think I'm going to use that and the DLO(?) case with the armband for the gym.  So far, so good."

The first few weeks i had it it worked fine, then the trouble started. The player began to lag like crazy, often would freeze up, and there are abslutely no affordable cases to protect the screen of the player. Many times what happens is when you choose to turn on the back light to change a song the light comes on but the screen stays black, and sometimes the backround would come up but no song name, VERY ANNOYING. Also the radio reception is extremely poor and I was only able to upload one video, because the media converter barely works, converting 1 of 16 videos. Also Sansa does not allow you to download clips of google video and then load them onto your computer. Another problem would be that whenever one would want to connect the computer 1 of 2 things would happen. 1 is that the songs load onto your computer at an extremely slow rate or the songs do not load at all period. I definately do not reccomend this mp3 player, it is slow and unreliable. Try the Zen Vision M though much better."
527335,A2XQ3CKGQPN1BS,0,1,209,B000ETVKHE,5/4/2007,4,0,0,"More than 4, less than 5 stars","The Good: beautiful video resolution, FM radio, voice recorder are all welcome additions to my mp3 player.  Movies look and sound great, everyone I've shown is truly impressed... then I tell them the price and they are even more impressed.  Wheel is actually a little easier than the iwheel for a stubby-handed guy like me to use.  Other functions were as expected, making me quite happy with my purchase. The Bad: you have to use the Sansa Convertor to get your videos and photos onto the device.  A standard movie that was 700 megs in mpg format ends up around 1 gig in sansa's .mov format (which is a little different than regular mov, but I'm not sure how).  I got the 4 gig and it pretty much fits only 4 movies with nothing else on board.  Were I to get another one, I would get the 8 giger.  I purchased a microSD to upgrade the memory, but the way the convertor works, you can't put movies and photos on that expanded memory.  Ear buds don't fit my ears well, but that's a personal issue. The Ugly: I've already scratched my screen!  When you buy this product, get a case that will protect the screen as well.

This one does everything that I wanted and more and does it well.  For some reason, Sandisk has an exclusive deal with that blue and yellow big box chain (you know the one) where they have a special firmware for this same player that gives you access to Rhapsody channels (subscription), automatically downloading playlists that are AWESOME.  It's like have your own personal FM station in your pocket.  This player blows away any other for this feature alone.  If you are going to buy this player, get it from that store. My biggest gripes with the Sansa are the tiny buttons that take too much effort to press (esp the menu/on-off button. Why should I need two hands for such a tiny device??).  The slowish boot time (~10 secs) didn't bother me at all. Pros: Price is nice, Dual DRM gives you plenty of choice, works fantastic with Rhapsody. Video is quite watchable. Packed with features that put the Nano to shame. Cons: Tiny buttons, easily scratched surface (you MUST buy a protector).  Accessory variety pales in comparison to the iPod selection. Media conversion software is so-so."

Finally they are basically washing their hands of the issue and saying they don't support the software they provided and require you to use (which comes from ARCsoft).

The iPod products do seem extremely well manufactured and obviously the after-market support is unparalleled, but I was leery of several iPod issues.  The first being no WMA support, which I have a 1000CD library ripped into, and the second primary issue was being locked into iTunes.  Of lessor importance was dealing with the battery issue of iPods (not user-changeable) and a lack of an FM radio. The Sansa appeared to be the best alternative, and so far I have been very pleased with it.  It is very simple to use, has plenty of volume, and the audio quality is good.  It requires no software installation outside of a small program for firmware upgrades.  It has a plethora of options on it, including the FM tuner, voice recorder, and some expandability with the MicroSD slot.  It's video capabilities will probably only appeal to very limited market (certainly not me).  It appears very well made and there is some gathering aftermarket support for accessories.  The battery life is exceptional, and replacement will be easy. The negatives that I have encountered is that it is certainly thicker than a Nano, although it is still a relatively small device.  The FM reception is rather weak.  It also has a minor sync issue with Windows Media Player in that the album art does not transfer to the player, but that is a minor quibble. Amazon's price at the time that I purchased my 4GB Sansa beat everyone else's by about $50, and I am very pleased with the value that the Sansa represents.  I have no qualms recommending it to anyone.  It is not perfect (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), but certainly fits the bill of a very serious iPod Nano alternative."

I went to their FAQs section hoping to find indepth directions on creating or uploading my playlists and the directions that were there were incorrect.  I wanted to be able to create a playlist in Windows Media player, sync up to my Sansa and upload the playlist, album and songs.  It doesn't quite work that way.

Of course you need better headphones, but the great features of this device are well-catalogued on other reviews. This is our family's 3rd MP3 player (I do love the Cowon for sound, but haven't used it since I got my e260, and just caved in to my son for a 2 GB 2nd gen. Nano; he likes to ""own"" music). But add in the Rhapsody service (virtually unlimited selection of music of all genres) usable on up to 3 computers and 3 portable music devices to the great feature bundle means everybody in the family gets everything they want for a total of $15 a month. As usual get as much memory as you can afford. Cons? I've had to reformat the device due to freezes twice in 1 month, the first time because I think it just needed a firmware upgrade, 2nd time because I tried to do too much with it (can't go into detail here, but watch adding too many ""channels"" at once to your device), but help (either on-line or via telephone) has been excelent. You do have to make the mental leap to ""renting"" music instead of owning it, but that is NOT a problem to me. For now, this is heaven."

I liked mine so much I got him one and he loves it too.  I went for a little more memory on his.  We use ours at work at our desks and at home when were tired of toddler music. We are not techies or anything but I love this MP3 player. It is easy to use and the sound is great."

I got it for $130 from Amazon, and got a second for my g/f for Christmas.  It holds plenty of music for me... I don't need to carry my entire library in my pocket, but with the expansion slot I could definitely increase the space if I wanted to.  And with the ease of transferring the data to it (with WMP11 or Winamp) I can easily remix the catalog on it to suite my taste. You'll definitely want to get a decent pair of earphones (Shure or the like) because it comes with the standard crappy uncomfortable plastic pellets that are supposed to hang just inside your ears but never stay in.  I'm not dinging the Sansa for this because I never expected it to have good earphones and I already have a set of Shure E3s.  A silicone skin for it is also a good way to protect its pretty glossy black exterior."

It has features such as fm radio, voice recording, as well as the video and music. I had tried the ipod nano before, and it doesn't come close. This player is less expensive than a 4GB apple mp3 player, and has better features, plus it has solid construction. My only irk to the product were the head phones, because they wouldn't stay in place, and would always fall out. But that isn't much of a problem considering there are many after market headphones you can get- (I recommend sony in ear style earbuds). Overall excellent product, the Sansa is great!

The scroll wheel works well but the movement could be just a little bit smoother.

The music sounds great, it's very compact, the screen is vivid and bright...a great mp3 for the money.  Amazon was even cheaper than Ebay and had free shipping.  The only problem she is having is taking photos off of it once she loaded them on.  Other than that , she loves it.  Totally worth the money."

The picture is quite nice for it's size and the menus work really well (just make sure you keep your ID3v2 tags updated). The sound is very nice and my wife can actually use it. Because you can plug it in as a flash drive it works really well with my linux box. Now for the bad news which is why I rated it a four. Sandisk decided that you could only use it's proprietary software for pictures and movies which is not compatible at all with linux hence I run into some trouble there. I don't mind so much that the usb port is the only way to charge it but I guess it would be nice to be able to plug it into my car. Oh well. Enjoy!

During my search for an mp3 player, I was hesitant at first because I did not know so much about the Sansa player and thought it might be safe to just go with an Ipod. However, i really do not regret my choice at all, because it is a great deal for its price. It looks nice, offers video, pictures, radio, and is easy when it comes to placing music on the player. Probably the only negative thing about it might be that it did freeze once, but that is easily fixed by holding the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. Great player for the price! shouldn't be turned down"
527300,AWKV823Q26BIB,0,0,174,B000ETVKHE,1/17/2007,5,0,0,Excellent MP3 Player,"This mp3 is by far the best hands down for price and functionality. I reviewed a lot of players and this one seemed to have the most functions for the price.  When I received it it was very easy to drag and drop music into the player. I tried using windows media, but it was very confusing to make a playlist and then send it to the player. But I also didn't take the time to actually sit down and find out what I was doing wrong. But overall this is a powerful little piece of equipment. If you use the playlist, be careful when scrolling to it. If you go to fast, it will lock up. Once it locks up, you have to take it apart and remove the battery to reset it. But that only happened to me one time. Now I take my time when going to the my preset playlist. If your listening to all music, you don't have to worry about that. The system must be accessing another part of the memory chip to retrieve the music. This baby is also powerful. I once took it to a party and I had the connections to hook it up to the their stereo system and we partied all nite long. No more need to lug around CD's. I loaded this baby up with my preset list and just let it go. You can control the volume through the player. Its great. People we're amazed at what this little baby can do. Also if you have ipod music on itunes, you can do a backdoor by downloading to a CD and then burning onto windows and loading it that way. This is time consuming, so I just go through yahoo to get my music. But if you we're dying to get an ipod, you can transfer your music this way. I would highly recommend this player to everyone."

All Sansa lines (the e250 and m240 512 and 1G versions) worked out well.  Only concerns have to do with few easily available accessories, a little getting used to the small buttons, and the learning curve that comes with using a new product.  The headphones and case with the m240 series need improvement.  Very pleased with e260, which has turned some heads.  Recommended."

527291,AZGFJAQUBT3NJ,0,1,165,B000ETVKHE,1/13/2007,3,0,0,Not So Cool Now,"I had bought this when it first came out. I hate the whole iPod idea and besides this had better features for way less. Video, Voice, Photos, Music, Radio, and Rhapsody Channels(which is irritating). But within a few weeks after I had bought the Sansa Player, small problems would show up. The screen would go black and would not light back up while still playing. Would freeze, Skip, and sometimes wouldn't even shut off!! I went to return it, but the store policy was only 16 days. wtf. I totally got ripped there. **Things I like about the Sansa player** Screen size and shape. Buttons. I like the little spin-dial. Recorder! Very nice and useful for school lectures. Great for showing photos. You can also stick in memory on the side. (Say you have a 4GB and you add 2GB now it's = 6GB). **Things I don't like about the Sansa player** Kind of heavy, not good for runners like me. Rhapsody Channels. First off it's taking away from the storage you have for your songs. Some music you just don't like. The channels take a long time to update. It's hard to spell Rhapsody without looking at it. You have to download their Rhapsody player. Now I have like three major players. iTunes, Windows Media Player, and now this! I have to rate all my songs here too! What a hassle. You have to sign up for it too, unfair. I eventually got a new one as a gift and I still have some of the same problems showing up here and there. Overall I recomend that you buy the pricey travel kit Sansa sells it has a screen protector and a leather holder, if you decided to buy this anyways. Just to make it last longer."

I had some issue with a kind of ghost file once, but found an easy solution in one of the sansa forums on the www. I have contacted sandisk customer service twice via email after registering my product over the sandisk website, every time they were very fine and fast, no problems with that aspect. Also, I know a lot of people complain about the main buttons size, and  I can tell you that the size is not the real issue, its the position of the buttons! they are really close to the volume wheel so people with large fingers may have a little problem pressing the buttons.

The UI design is strictly OK and so is the flimsy cover which ships with it. It takes a major hit in sound quality. Its got just two options Normal and High, and even on the High setting, the sound is not great! The FM quality is also kinda OK. There are few fixed equaliser options. Another area of worry is the Charging. It can only be charged through a USB port, it ships with a cable to connect to your machine. This can get irritating especially if you're on a journey and you're not carrying your laptop around. The battery life is pretty sturdy. I ususally use Windows Media player for syncing my music to it. Its pretty easy and simple. The earplugs shipped with it are a nice fit. I guess at its cost, its a good bet!"

My wife and I use the player for our indoor bike workouts--just pop the earbuds in and one dosen't bother anyone else in the house.

With the expansion slot, Sandisk's reputation, video capabilities, and PHOTO slideshows, WOW!  I think the expansion slot is what really sold me, gee who knows how many gigs you need until you've used all yours up and you need to buy a bigger one!  I figured that 4 GB would be plenty, but to be able to expand the memory is a neat feature.  But altogether this thing is neat and what a great deal.  If you had all these features in an ipod it would cost twice that much, at least. The only drawback is I wish that these companies would sell them WITH a protective case (not the cheapy sleeves they come with).  Honestly it is HARD to find a case that says it fits Sansa, and many probably do, but you would have to open a lot of packages to find out.  I did find one or two, but with all the dern ipod cases out there, it was frustrating to find one that said Sansa on it.  Maybe Sansa will start putting a 'real' protective case in the package and just up the price 10 bucks.  We did have a problem with one of them getting 'stuck' and couldn't figure out what to do.  We called the 800 number and the customer service was great.  Told us how to turn it off (just press the button and hold for 20 seconds to get unstuck), power it back up and it has been fine ever since.  That's another great feature to have nice customer service!  Don't pass these up - at this price anyone can have one - even the older generations will be able to figure these out!"

When I go on trips I am able to store photos and movie clips of my family.  This keeps me smiling.  I love the voice recorder that the sansa has.  I have used it in many church service times to record and listen later to the pastors words.  However, I have noticed that when recording in a large arena or church santuary venue the sound recording level is not the greatest, having a slight hissing or whistling sound.  In smaller areas, it's good.  The radio feature is cool as well.  Small screen is a turn down when viewing the movies and pics, but we have to remember that we're going for the same size and portablity of a nano.  For price and features the sansa KILLS the nano.  Granted it may not be as easy to spin the dial as a nano and the buttons are acutal buttons, where as the nano and ipod are skin sinsitive.  I never owned an ipod or nano, so if I am missing something, I don't know it.  Once again, for features, price, and storeage ablity and expandablity, go with the Sansa."

The player is everything it was claimed to be. FM tuner gets ok reception, not great reception though. The portability is great and it can take a beating. No problems with the battery life. I would like to be able to still use the device while plugged into the computer. (When docked, it goes into a transfer mode, making the buttons of the sansa inoperational). The only issues Ive had with the player, is ""Rhapsody to go"". This service has a great selection of music...but functionally sucks. Has issues updating license subscriptions. Between the Sansa and the Zune...anyone buying an iPod is an idiot. If you want something ultra-portable get the sansa. If you want the same features with larger storage and a larger screen...get a Zune. One thing the Sansa doesn't do (that the Zune does) is allow for pluging in an AV out cable, so you can run your zune to a larger screen (in car LCD's, home TV).

Radio: On irregular intervals at every few hours of listening, reception will gradually get very fuzzy. Ive found it can be fixed by switching radio stations away and then back to station I'm listening to.  The manual recommends attaching the USB cable for better reception, but that seems to make no difference, and who wants to walk around with a usb cable. Music:  Navigation is ok, except if I am listening to a song and want to chose another song.  To do this, I have to press the power button and go all the way back to the main menu, select music player, then chose album/artist, then I can chose another song.  Dumb. During both music and radio, player will freeze, mine seems to do this about twice a week.  So far, pressing the power button for 15 seconds has resolved the issue.  The scroll wheel is cool but it lets dust in under the screen cover, and sometimes it feels ""sticky"" though ive kept it reasonably clean.

But, that happens with all mp3 players, I seem to hear anymore. Well, the picture is quite good, and it's not hard to use. The computer reconizes it in a short period of time. And, then WMP10 will be able to sync music on to it. I do enjoy the fact it has the expansion slot, since if you become a music freak, it's okay. This is good for it's money, and will hold up a while. A thing about it is, that is scratches extremely easily, so I'd suggest getting a case with a screen cover. It's probably a good investment, and I am yet to buy a case. But, the sound quality is good, and I am pleased. I would recommend this product."

The video converting software is included but don't expect Zune beating quality. The screen is bigger than the Nano's and doesn't look that small if compared to the IPod Video's. A huge drawback is that when you sync using Windows Media Player 11, the album art is not transferred unless you paste the album art manually. A shame since WMP 11 is the only version so far that allows for playlist transfer. Also, beware of the ""Zuney Curse"". Right after my brother installed the Zune software in our family PC my Sansa started crashing, and the only way to fix it was to open it, remove the battery and give it a chkdisk to fix the file system errors it had. As long as I plug it only in my room's PC, which has never been connected to the Zune, it won't crash; but recently I decided to try it in the family PC again just to see the same results. Also, right after plugin my brother's Zune to my XBOX 360, the 360 stopped detecting the songs in each of my Sansa's playlists."

It's EASIER TO USE than the iPod - no iTunes, yea! It has WAY MORE FEATURES than the iPod - big screen, FM radio, voice and radio recorder, expandable memory. So far I have had no problems with it freezing up, as some of the reviews say it does. Hopefully I'm not speaking too soon. But so far I LOVE IT!"

If I had it to do over I would pick this one every time."

527262,A2BOT5Q8IJH8L7,0,1,136,B000ETVKHE,1/3/2007,4,0,0,Good Sound/Quality,"Overall, this device is exactly what I wanted in a music player.  The display is superb and the sound is excellent.  The one problem is the provided earbuds.  They do not have very good sound and are a bit uncomfortable. But I think most devices come with inferior earbuds anyway. The other problem is the controls.  The buttons are often hard to use in that the wheel in the middle used to adjust volume and select items is raised.  This then makes the buttons around it harder to press.  In other words, the wheel is in the way. If I could, I would actually give this device a 4.5, but because of the limitations in the rankings, I could not do that.  But I cannot give a 5 for this device because of the controls. But I would tell you to not make this an issue to not buy this device. i feel that it is a very good device with excellent sound, screen, and portability."

527259,A1CCWC7X7U7IV3,0,1,133,B000ETVKHE,1/3/2007,3,0,0,"Good specs, mediocre implementation",I have owned a couple of ipods and this is my first Sandisk mp3 player.  I bought it because: - FM Tuner - Recording capabilities (records from mic and FM tuner). - Expansion slot - Its priced less than 4GB ipod nano. Now for weaknesses: - Controls.  The buttons are small and hard to press.  And I dont even have thick fingers.  The wheel that is the primary interface to the device is made of cheap plastic and does not move smoothly and occasionally gets stuck. - Included headset has a very short cable. - The interface can sometimes be confusing.  But maybe I am too new to the device. - Overall the device has a cheap feel to it and if you have if you have owned any of the recent ipod videos or nanos you'll know that this device is not in the same league.
527258,A306NASGVUDFKF,1,0,132,B000ETVKHE,1/1/2007,4,0,0,Very nice & easy to use item,"This is a slick little item that will store around 500, high quality MP3/WMA files.  It is straight forward to use - just sync it up with Windows Media player and you are all set to go.  the battery last a really long time.  I can play for 12+ hours on a single charge.  We do a lot of road trips and use this as our on board player. It is a well made, rugged player and the screen has great resolution.  The wheel is a bit small as are the buttons, but I can certainly live with it. The only down side is that Windows Media player can be a bit clunky with copy-protected songs.  I have stopped using downloaded files altogether as half the time they will not sync up with this unit.  This is not a design flaw of SanDisk's but rather a Windows issue in my opinion. I would give this 5 stars if it had its own software management system that was better than Windows Media player, but it does not."

I hope you can because some of my husbands music made it on there and its no good. anyway really love this thing makes my days go by faster I think I'm going to try and put an audio book on this thing.

Initially, the sound quality is mediocre, however, all this changes dramatically for the better once the firmware update is downloaded into the mp3 player. The firmware update transforms this little lamb of an mp3 into a mega sound monster! In order to get an adjustable custom EQ, you must use the firmware update on sandisk's website.This update allows you to personalize your sound preference through the player. The sound is excellent (with firmware update).If you're an audiophile, this is the choice. The only drawbacks are the awkward positioning of the control buttons, the lack of an ac charger and case as well as the functionality of the buttons. In order to use the photo and video features, you must use the proprietary software that's provided in the box. Otherwise, this is an excellent player! PROS: -Excellent sound (with firmaware update) -Decent picture and video display -Excellent battery life -Expandable memory CONS: -Awkward control positions--hard to reach buttons -Mediocre sounding FM radio -No ac charger -No case -Cheap ""tinny"" sounding earbuds (Sound improves dramatically with better headphones) -Has a tendency to freeze up once in a while (Hold down power button for 15 seconds  when this occurs) Overall, the Sansa E200 series is an audiophile's dream!!!"
527254,A246WLRG7YZ6NW,0,1,128,B000ETVKHE,12/5/2006,4,0,0,storage capability is misleading,"I just got this and am very excited about using it for video and photos as well as music. However, the print on the box saying ""4G = 1000 songs"" is quite misleading. I was able to put only about 300 songs on it in MP3 format, after deleting the couple hundred songs that came preloaded. There is a folder named ""System"" containing 1.4 Gigs of stuff, which I'm not sure is essential or not. I haven't found anything on SanDisk's support website about this folder. Anyway, 4G actually = 300 songs, so buy the Sansa with the most space you can afford. Especially since the price increase for a model with 2G more space is less than the price of a 2G SD drive."

This is a solid flash-based DAP with good support for online subscriptions (less finiky than my H10).  Quality is good, shuffle is reasonably random, battery life has been far beyond my expectations.  Only real quirk is when a license expires, sometimes it skips the song with a message (which its suppose to do) or sometimes it plays it scrambled for about 10 seconds and then skips.

It shiped very fast too. i expected it to be at my house in a week or so because it was free shipping. its monday and is at my house, the thing is i ordered it on thursday. if you want a quality flash mp3 player buy this. you cant go wrong its made by a flash drive company. A+ Amazon."
527250,ATUW69AECZJDL,0,0,124,B000ETVKHE,6/27/2007,3,3,5,Lets be realistic...good but not great.,"People seem to be overrating this product just because it is not an iPod.  Is everyone so amazed by the fact that another company can but out a halfway decent mp3 player?  I think their expectations of this unit are way too low. Anyway, here's the good stuff. +Good style, the blue on black is very nice. +Cheap, you're not gonna find this much storage for this price in any other mp3 player. +Its not an iPod, which means it will work with subscription music services like Napster and Rhapsody and you don't have to use iTunes. Now for the bad. -The e200 does have some quality issues.  Others have already mentioned that it may stop playing out of one side of your headphones.  This has happened intermittently on mine over the past 2 months I've had it.  It also lost all my music licenses so all the files on there were useless.  I had to wait until I got home that now and format the whole thing then copy over 3gb of songs again. -The middle wheel is just not right.  It is no where near as smooth as the iPod's or the creative zen's navigation control.  You'll find that sometimes it just goes one too far. -It takes awhile to boot up.  It takes somewhere between around 15 seconds to turn on where you'll be standing there having to listen to other people talk on their cell phones. -The hold button is not well placed.  It is too close to the headphone jack on the top so it cannot be reached easily when trying to take off hold with just your right hand. -The interface needs to be streamlined.  When listening to music it takes two separate button clicks to get back to your music list.  Depending on where you go it may have to hit another button twice to get back.  The center wheel can be used to navigate up and down but you can also also use the buttons located on the top and bottom of it to do the same thing.  This is redundant.  Instead the functionality should be spread out allowing quicker navigation. All in all this is a good mp3 player.  The best reason to buy it however is its price.  Compared side by side to other units it doesn't stand up.  A few small fixes and it could be an iPod killer, but right now its more of an ankle biter."
527249,A3C8R2PLAWK1WZ,0,1,123,B000ETVKHE,1/27/2007,4,3,5,Love it.,"I love this thing.  It takes a little longer to start up than an ipod, but if you can't wait ten seconds to listen to some music, you've got bigger problems than any mp3 player can fix.  Also, from what I understand, this is because it's got flash memory instead of a hard drive.  I consider this a bonus, seeing as everyone I know with an ipod has had the hard drive fail. I also really like that the wheel is an actual wheel.  The ipod wheel is way to sensitive for my tastes, and the zune clicky thing is kinda clunky and weird. This is nice little plastic wheel that actually turns and gives me some tactile sense of how far I'm turning the dial. The drag and drop functionality doesn't work all that well for me, but it takes so little time to synchronize using WMP that I really don't mind. The built-in microphone is surprisingly decent, too.  Yes, you can ONLY charge it via USB, but the battery lasts for quite a while, so I haven't run into any problems with that yet. All in all, this is a really nice player and is considerably cheaper than the competition.  I recommend it."

And I'm really glad I intercepted, and she never received this product. She never would have gotten it to work, and knowing her she would feel too bad to let me know. The player would not hold a charge. I left it plugged into the 2.0 USB(yes, it was on) for 24 hours, and still could not get the Sansa's power to turn on. Could only see the screen if it was plugged into the computer. The Sansa was completely useless as an mp3 player, maybe it could serve as a very expensive flashdive. How useful. Also limited format, I realize a good portion of my portable music collection is in mp4 which this player would not recognize. Would have had to take a bit of time converting files to get it on there for her. If it would have worked in the first place. Overall I wasted about 10hrs trying to get this thing to work, and even had to call Sandisk customer service for help(Later I was shocked to find the $12 charge for calling customer service!I'm not kidding, $12!),they tried to reset the e260 by having me follow a certain reset procedure, which involved holding the power button for 30seconds, and now I've forgotten the other things I had to do to supposedly ""reset"" the device. They decided the device was ""defective"" -their words, and ended up recommending I return the product where I bought it, thanks Amazon. Return was hassle free, and Amazon even payed for the shipping. It seems from the reviews that some people have had much better luck with the Sansa e260, and I understand there are always a couple lemons in the batch. But I'm not willing to give it another try. I've also recently read that the e260 has been discontinued. I'm looking into the SanDisk FUZE instead."

Paying full-price seemed a bit high at this point, so I decided to go with a refurbished for the savings.  The one I got works well, just not as good as a new one (or as good as the one I had had).  There's a small problem with the volume control changing on its own, which is a continual irritant, but not life-threatening."

I had owned and preferred Windows based mp3 players (Creative and Rio) but she bought into the hype and had to have an iPod. Over time, she started to get annoyed with iTunes and their ""exclusive"" music management system. Now that she has the Sansa she will never go back. You can use their music management software if you like, but you can also just cut and paste folders like any other windows storage device. It is far easier to use and more flexible. She loves the controls, the sound is great, and it is far less expensive than the annoying to use iPod. PLUS - the micro SD expansion slot is a great feature. For $13 we bought a card and added 2GB of space. We have not, to this point, used the video or photo feature so I can't speak to that. Overall, this is the 7th mp3 player we've owned in our household - it is a great device and a tremendous value."

My computer wouldn't recognize it at all. I have the same problem with the 4 GB. I can now only use it on my work computer. My home computer is fairly old and only has USB 1.1. I am not sure if that was the problem but that's what I blamed it on. My work computer is USB 2.0. The mp3 player works good but I don't like the ear phones. They do a horrible job of blocking out outside noise because they don't go inside your ear. I use some free no-name ear phones with it instead and they actually go into my ears and block out a lot more noise. The player also doesn't come with a CD like the 2 GB does. It also doesn't have USB modes. If you plan on buying this player I recommend that you either get a new computer or get a MAC. Apparently these things aren't compatible with older computers.

It has a good size, feels sturdy but a bit on the heavy side. The interface is nice, easy to use, but as someone pointed out you cannot delete a file from the player, you must use the computer. The beautiful wheel gets on the way of the buttons, also pointed out by others, and though it is not very smooth it turns reasonably well unless you are trying to go through a lot of songs at once. Then there is the whole issue of only being able to charge it through an usb connection, together with the fact that it uses a proprietary cable and you can't just use one of the standard usb cables available on the market (ok, many players have the same issue...). One other concern are the openings for the microsd card slot and the cable connections that have no protection. Being able to add extra memory is a nice feature. It sounds good but the earphones that come with it are of low quality what brings me to the issue that you can't adjust the equalizer to your own   settings; you have to use one of the preset options. The Sansa e260 is ok for adding some family videos to carry around, but seriously, who is going to watch a whole video in such a small screen? It is not the main purpose of the player; if you want to watch videos get a larger screen/larger storage video player. 4GB is a great amount of memory for music, that is why I bought it. Curious that the movies are .mov, a quicktime/apple standard, and yet it doesn't support mac, you can't even access it as a hard drive if you plug it into a mac."

BEWARE of who you buy electronics from, some sellers will list it as new , but it will either be used or be a defective item..  The e260 should come in its orginal factory sealed packaging, including user manual, earphones and USB cord...  if it doesnt come with any of these or its not in its orginal packing DO NOT BUY IT!!!! DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE SELLER FULLTIME ELECTRONICS!!!  THEY HAVE RIPPED OFF MANY CUSTOMERS BY SELLING USED PRODUCTS THAT WERE LISTED AS NEW.  NOTHING THEY HAVE IS NEW, ITS ALL USED OR DEFECTIVE ITEMS. IM JUST TRYING TO SAVE YOU THE HASSLE OF TRYING TO GET A REFUND THROUGH AMAZON...

I loved the menu and I thought it was much easier than any ipod. It was very simple to understand and I picked up on how to use everything quickly. After about a year however... it was awful! This mp3 player ended up crashing my computer! I lost everything! Hundreds and hundreds of songs lost! I also had to pay for a new computer! I was so upset. It had other problems prior to this such as it freezing occasionally and never shutting down but I was shocked when this happened because it had been a pretty good brand!I would say though not having an ipod is a flat out pain! Everything now is compatible with the ipods and buying any songs, games, videos, movies or accessories to go with it is almost impossible. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!! I also want to mention that after awhile it doesn't allow you to play songs! It is the most annoying thing! It becomes very hard to put songs onto the mp3 player and often times songs that had been working for months and months will just abruptly stop working. Towards the end I would spend hours putting cds on and almost 50% of it wouldn't work!"

I love that it is light weight, I can put it in my purse comfortably and that it is easy to manuever. The bad part is that I still do not know how to turn off a song. I have to power off Sandisk to stop the music. Also, when I am loading the music from my computer to the player, it keeps loading all the music, not only the certian ones I want to hear. I am still going to play with it and hopefully will be able to figure it out soon. I do highly reccommend this player to anyone who is buying their first mp3 player. It is worth the price."

I like the Radio feature too but one thing that fails is the video feature.. you'd think that a video that is 640x480 on your computer and 20mbs would be smaller in size when converted to such small res. but thats not the case here... the video triples and sometimes quadruples in size! its amazing. I don't like how the little software that Sandisk provides us with gives us absolutely no control over the settings while converting a video.. and longer videos don't even convert fully... say past a minute? it just stops.  but it's alright since I don't really plan on watching any video on a screen that small. Over all I'd recommend this strictly for the music. if you want video, go get an ipod video or a zune. they are much more better."

I spent several hours trying to have it work with various programs or use what was on it to no avail.  I finally was able to delete some gimmicky software from the player and then transfer mp3s to the player either by using the OK Musicmatch Jukebox portable manager and then finally by dragging and dropping.  Either transfer method lost the titles of many of the songs, though they remained sorted by album/artist.  The player's ""wheel"" is a poor knock-off of the ipod's, which in its many forms that I have used is the best 'hardware' for mp3s that I have found (although I am not a fan of it due to its specific file type & software).  The e260r also has non-intuitive ""pause"" for stop... no actual ""stop"" that is apparent... and often a hidden ""resume song"" (or something to that effect) to get back to where the user was... and other awkward features.  I'm glad I borrowed this player... now I can give it back."

I had it 2 weeks and it froze, the display became a quater white. I had a lot of good music on there which I can't get back so it is really bad for me. I had to send it in and just good a new one. I try it one more time then I give up.

After I opened it i realised it used a kind of stupid construction on the inside, and fixing the jack was vertualy imposible... it needed replacement perhaps.

I have found that the output level isn't all that great when you connect up to an FM transmitter for your car, but as for headphone volume it kicks butt. I can't believe that I am half way full on storage, I didn't think the external drive would be of concern but now finding that it might be a Godsend now. Sandisk did a good job in the navigation so if you get lost you shouldn't be using anything more technical than a calculator. :).....j/k"

The listed features looked great and I looked forward to putting it to immediate use.  I wanted one so I could play WAV or MP3 files that I generate myself of different training materials.  The concept of having a portable device that I could use to load any of my files onto and take with me sounded like a great idea and the added features were a bonus.  I've now spent over 8 hours trying to figure out how to make MP3 files, generated from my WAV files, that I've and dragged and dropped as described in the sparce paperwork that comes with the player play, pretty much to no avail.  I have managed to get Windows Media Player to sync up with the MP3 player to move MP3 files that will actually play to the player but when I try to arrange them in a logical order so I can find them they won't play anymore.  I've emailed customer support and so far the responses have been of no help.  This is my first MP3 player so these devices are new to me.  Perhaps if I'd previously owned an iPod or some other player it would all make sense.  I hate having to figure out how something works by trial and error which is how I feel about this device.  Why can't better instructions be provided?  I'm about a day from returning the player and having them refund the money to my son.  It's not worth the hassle trying to figure it out!"

The IPOD can only play mp3 files, but the sansa can play several different formats which gives me more flexibility and choices on where I buy my music.  And for about $100 cheaper than the IPOD!  The sound quality is perfect.  And this device is very user friendly.

Sounds I could never hear on cheap earbuds, I can hear with them.  For example, the high pitched, squelchy system noises that my new Sansa generates at random but frequent intervals.  Tried it with some crappy earbuds--couldn't hear those awful sounds (couldn't hear much else, either...).  Ah, but with my Plugs, there they are.  Harping along with Kate Rusby and her delicate melodies, standing out even between the beats in loud, thumping electronica.  I have tried and failed to ignore these noises, but if you're content with the bundled earbuds, this player might be fine for you. But I have other issues too.  None so bad as the system noises with my earbuds of choice, but collectively I think they will probably lead to my returning this product. There are two different settings for max volume, and top one is only barely adequate.  This is with my Plugs--poor man's in ear isolators, and much more efficient at converting a watt into a thump than regular earbuds--and with regular earbuds the max max volume is totally inadequate.  Not that I want to blow my ears out, but there are just a few songs that I must listen to at full bore. The user interface has some annoying niggles.  If I am in the main menu, I have to press the power button to go back to the now playing screen, but if I am in the context menu, it is the back button that takes me back to now playing.  This is obnoxious.  It takes far more button presses than it should to rate a song, which requires too much attention that should be diverted to say, my job, or riding my bicycle.  And if it is in random play, I cannot go back later at a better time to rate the song (which is how I remember songs I've never heard but like), because the random play is random both forwards _and backwards_.  Annoying.  I'm no fan of iPods' but I believe with them, you just press in on the center button a couple of times, roll the wheel to your desired rating, and then one more press on the center to lock it in.  Mucho mas grande.  Also, after the screen dims, any button pressed only restores the backlight, and so it is generally necessary to press a button twice to do anything.  This fact exacerbates the buttons' poor tactile feedback into a worse isue than it should be.  And sometimes playing an album's songs results in one song playing twice and one not being played at all. The player has crashed on me.  Upon unplugging from the computer in MTP mode, it refused to switch back to the player.  It actually flickered between the menu screen and the usb connection screen, and I was able to navigate to the settings, change the usb mode to MSC, and restart the player by plugging it into my computer and unplugging (as normally happens in MSC mode).  It also crashes if I get punchy and push any buttons during the three seconds in which it is hung up right after rating a song. Pluses:  I'm not recommending this product, unless you believe my issues won't bother you.  But if they don't, the screen is very nice, large and well backlit, and I enjoy the tactile feel and speed and accuracy of the scroll wheel, much like the first generation iPods, before they went to electrostatic wheels.  The case is very attractive and feels durable, battery life is good, and the price is certainly right.  But the musical contributions it makes are most unwelcome!!"
527173,A2PO7XCX5M6R5,0,1,47,B000ETVKHE,10/9/2007,2,3,7,I have never done this before...,"Like i said i have never written a review for a product ever in my life. Im 20 years old and was looking for a smaller mp3 player for the gym because my 30g i pod is just a bit to bulky. So i did some research and it seemed everyone liked the Sansa, so i flew over to BestBuy and picked one up. Well, i got it home and loved the design it was pocket friendly, lightweight, and seemed durable. But this is where all the fun stopped. I opened the package and it said ""Install CD Before Connecting."" Haha, funny thing is Vista would not read the cd, and i have a brand new computer about 3 weeks old. So i said meh, and plugged it in anyway. To my suprise this thing came jack loaded with about 15 songs and 30 photos! So i was like ok...ill just delete them. Than i noticed something else. Out of the supposed 4 gb availbe it was really only 3.71, granted room for software etc, i understand. But here's the kicker...After deleting all of the pre-set music and photos i had 1.71gb out fo 3.71gb. Thats with this thing completly empty!!! Not even 2gb's of room?! Ok Ok so its got and upgradeable sd slot. A 4gb card is another 40$ So there is 160$ spent. I hate ipod for the itune only software, but this Sansa just made me angry. Im returning it today and getting something else. Just a warning to everyone out there. But since i havent read anyone else have the same problem as me, maybe mine was just defective. Oh Well all well that end well. If you have any questions, please get in contact with me. I hope this review helped!"

This player is horrible!! It began duplicating songs in the playlist and cutting songs off in the middle of play within 2 months. I called customer support for Sandisk and it was a challenge just to understand them..they sounded like they were in a tunnel in BF Egypt and could barely speak English. They told me the Mp3 player must be ""corrupted"" and sent me a link for a patch via e mail. This happened 2 or 3 times before they finally agreed to replace it.  I had to mail it back in and they would send me a replacement ""within 7 to 10 business days"".  Well, as of today, it has been over a month and I am still waiting. After 2 phone calls, I am told each time that it is in the warehouse and should ship any time...call back and check later. My husband and I both have Apple Ipods and havent had any problems in 2 yrs.

Then today his Sandisk Sansa e260 fell 2 feet to the floor while he was sitting down and now the screen is destroyed with lines running through it internally. One would think that a 24"" fall would not be enough to destroy a flash drive player, but even a rubber skin on the player was not enough to protect this poorly designed player from internal damage. I called the Sandisk company and spoke with a manager who stated that the Sandisk players are not designed to resist ANY TYPE of falls ""even if it only falls 12"" or less."" I did not tell this manager that our kids previously owned the Sandisk Sansa m240 which not only stood up to the abuse of MANY impacts and falls, but one of them went through the wash and still worked! The new Sandisk Sansas do not hold up to the quality that their players once were.

The reason that I love it so much is the expandibility factor. You can easily add a Micro SD disk in it and immediately have another batch of songs added. This is great when I put my holiday music on the extra chip and only play that during the holiday season. I also love the shuffle feature and that you can create lists from the WMP and move the lists over to it. Put your faves in a list and only play them if you so desire. You can also buy a car adapter that works through the car adapter and radio. When it is plugged in, it charges the Sansa as it is playing. I believe the adapter is by Griffin. (It does have a numeric display of the radio stations and you have to put the car on the same station.)"

If you are adding any pictures or videos you have to put it through a converter which takes forever and a day. I added a family guy clip that was only 2 minutes it took 10 minutes to convert to the sandisk mp3.

I chose this over an iPod nano, but I think it's basically a toss-up between the two. Pros of the sansa: - it's just a tad bigger than the nano - you can download songs from pretty much anywhere - you get voice recording, radio, and video with the sansa - it's a little cheaper - replacable battery- I assume they'll start selling these at some point? Cons: - the syncing is not exactly intuitive; it really only works well with Windows Explorer, and it's inexplicably hard to get playlists on the sansa - if you don't press the menu button just right when you turn it on, it freezes and you have to reset it.  It's a weird and annoying problem. - no accessories!  I had one choice for an armband to use for running. - do you really need video on your mp3 player?  Especially little crappy videos? - the voice recording only recored 3-min increments, and you can't upload it to your computer- so forget about bootlegging concerts, or even sharing a lecture with your friends. I used my friend's nano and had no problem getting songs on it, so it is the player, not me.  I wouldn't say this is bad, and I'm glad there's an alternative to ipods, but when you're paying $200 there shouldn't be so many annoyances."

It's cheap, ultra-portable and plays ""to-go"" music without any problems. In fact, the CD that comes with the C140 includes Rhapsody Jukebox software and required Windows Media Player 10. Set up was easy and navigation on the little tiny screen was fine (although graphics are not clear and appear in low-resolution). I wouldn't want to use it for viewing images which it is capable of. Having the FM is a plus. Everything was good until I listened to the music from Rhapsody. I used decent headphones, Sony MDR-V700. Unfortunately, the sound quality I was getting was not good enough. Volume was low so I had to crank it up high-and at a high volume level, there was too much distortion. Bass was boxy and mids and highs were tinny, fuzzy and weak. So I returned the C140 and purchased the Samsung YP-Z5. After using the Samsung, it was clear that it wasn't that the quality of the downloaded to-go music was bad-it was the quality of the c140. I never even had a had a chance to play higher bit-rate MP3/WMA files. Perhaps they'll sound better. But I still wouldn't recommend it since I found that there are better players out there (although they are more expensive)."

I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library.  So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed.  I was wrong.  When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum.  This also travels over to recording.  You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow.  Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had.

Over the years I've tried tapes, CDs and a variety of book readers including the iPod and Zen. No book reader I've found works as well as this model c140 from Sandisk. It's small, light, inexpensive, easy to control, makes bookmarks reliably, makes it easy to load and unload Audible books, and makes it easy to manage MP3 files using Windows Explorer. This player takes ordinary AAA batteries that you can get anywhere. My gym displays several TV screens in the ""hamster room"" and uses short-range FM transmissions so members can pick up the station they want to watch. So when I see a TV program I want I switch over to, it lets me quickly and easily switch to the Sansa's FM tuner and keep on running. When the Sansa's battery goes dead--about once every 12 hours--I it takes seconds to put in another AAA battery. They're cheap and when I've forgotten to put one in my pocket, I've gotten replacements from road-side convenience stores and from the little convenience rack at the gym, but I've always been able to keep on listening. Audible recommends that you download audio-books for the Sansa in level 4 format. At that level, sound quality is excellent although, admittedly, the player cannot be turned up loud enough to pound your eardrums unless you plug it into an external amplifier and play it through a good set of speakers. I got the model c140 to replace an older Sansa e140 that I used for two years. The older one never gave me any trouble but this one is said to have an improved operating system making it easier to control. I debated getting a c150 with twice the memory and only $[...] higher price, but the largest books I own (a biography of Harry Truman and the fantasy book A Storm of Swords) are each over 40 hours long, and either one will fit on the c140 with enough room left for two ordinary length audio-books. The c140 delivered all I hoped for and then some."

I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features.  However, after just one month it locked up on me and wouldn't do anything.  I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product.  This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day.  I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player.  I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product."
527115,AR7NK1XK62ACD,0,0,87,B000EUCMWK,10/19/2006,3,6,6,Fine for my purposes,"I already had an iPod but needed an even smaller player for travel, and wanted a device that I could run on batteries even in countries where I can't rely on stable electricity. This machine fit the bill and has been fine thus far--as others have mentioned, it's easy to load and operate, and very lightweight. It also has better FM reception than the stereo with antenna does in the same room. I can't really say what the battery life is like because I've been swapping them out early, but I do notice that the device can be off for long periods (say, two weeks) and still power up when turned on. This is different from my iPod and PDAs I've had, which lose their charge over time even when not in use."
527114,A1KCNGG3NBG05A,0,1,86,B000EUCMWK,8/25/2006,1,6,6,"Good features, poor performance","I bought this mp3 player as an upgrade from an old 60mb player I had been using. The size, the AAA battery, the FM tuner / recorder were all great features for the price. When I first tried it out, I noticed a bad distortion on everything in the mid to low range at normal volume. I thought it might be the ear buds so I plugged in my high-dollar headphones and it was still there. Next I tried out the FM tuner, which had the same distortion problem. And if that wasn't enough, as soon as the display light went out, a horribly annoying hum started up. I hit one of the buttons, which turned the light back on, and the hum stopped. Then the light went back off and the hum started up again. After some internet searching I found that this is a common problem with this player. The first time I plugged it into the USB port it worked for a while then froze up and wouldn't respond to any key presses. I had to remove the battery and put it back in. This is apparently another common problem. So I went to the Sandisk website to try to download a firmware update, hoping that might solve these problems, and there wasn't one available for this model. So in a last ditch effort (after wasting lots of time and brain cells) I emailed tech support detailing the problems I was having. I was immediately sent an autoreply message saying that my question had been assigned to a support specialist and would be answered promptly. Two days later when I still hadn't received any response (it has now been four days as of this writing) I took the thing back and bought an iPod nano, which is in a whole different league from this player, and worth every penny. My only regret is that I didn't go ahead and spend the money on the iPod to begin with, which would have saved me a lot of grief. On the positive side, at least now I have a much greater appreciation for the quality of the iPod."

I got this one because I decided to give Play for Sure a try--and have fallen in love with subscription music afterall!!  I chose this one because it was on sale, relatively cheap, 1gb, small, and seemed to be sturdy built. I have synced it almost daily for a month now and played it to death at work.  It has worked without a hitch.  The only drawback is that it uses an AAA battery that does not last very long, but that is par for the course with these cheap flash units.  The sound is decent, and  it has an FM radio and microphone.  There is a round button on the front that contains the menu, pause, forward and back controls. Often times I must press a button twice to get it to go forwards or backwards.  The unit automatically  shuts off if you pause for very long, which is actually good considering the battery life.  I use it with Napster and it takes a while to sync, but that is OK.  It has a dedicated volume control and a hold button that feel solid and well made.  The screen is smallish but well lit and colorful with a  simple menu.  I absolutely will buy more Sansa products after my experience with this one!  Now I kinda wish I had not bought the Nano and had instead gotten a bigger Sansa for my play to go subscriptions."

The battery life is very long. I recommend buying AAA rechargable batteries. The lanyard to hang around your neck that comes with the player is very handy. It comes with about 20 pre-programmed songs but you can delete them. Putting songs into the mp3 player is very easy and fast. There's a cd that comes with the player but you don't need it because it's just instructions and there is a very abridged version on paper. The only thing I don't like about this player is that when I scroll through an alphabetical list of songs, artists, or albums, and select one and return to the previoius menu, I have to start over from ""A"" again. So it takes a lot of clicks to get to the middle of the alphabet. The FM radio works really well too. However, you have to scroll through a lot of channels to get to the end everytime you exit it. So you have to preset a station to make it easier."

I traded my flash with an amp, no screen, 256Mb, no brand, mp3 player for a SanDisk Sansa C140.  I purchased Sandisk because of their good name in the flash memory market. Things I liked: 1.) Compact size 2.) Not too bad battery life on alkaline batteries. 3.) Easy synch. with Windows Media Player 10. Things I disliked. 1.) Poor instructions both printed or on CD. 2.) No explanation of protocols used for downloading. 3.) No clear indication that it can be used with Windows Media Player - no instructions how to actually perform a synch.. Things I really hated. 1.) It came with a biggish bunch of pre-programmed songs which were not visible via any windows file management tool that I could find.  They remained after synching my new playlists.  There were no instructions anywhere to indicate how to get rid of them.  In the end a nervous 'format' of the disk got rid of them and did not affect the operation of the machine.

I much prefer the idea of simply popping in a new battery rather than having to plug the entire unit into a power source... and wait.

Figured to send it back if it didn't work well. Don't buy this for the screen.  The color looks washed out and the edges are not very good for displaying.  The design is fairly easy to use and I have no problems hitting the right buttons through the pockets of my shorts. This thing was SO easy to set up it was ridiculous.  You don't even need their software if you are using XP.  I had their songs off and mine on in 5 minutes using Windows Media Player.  The standard USB rule applies:  DON'T unplug it from the USB connection without first shutting down the port from Windows.  Like almost all USB devices it will hang if you do, and you will have a piece of scrap electronics if you do it enough times. The sound quality is not particularly great.  My old Rio Sport, using technology from about 5 years ago, sounded better.  On the plus side, battery life seems very good so far.  I play it in a noisy health club so have the volume cranked up pretty good.  It has played MP3's for about 6 hours so far and the battery indicator is still almost full. 1GB is more than enough storage for me.  I have every song I would listen to more than once on it and have barely filled half the device.  Could have gotten by just fine with a 500MB unit but it's nice knowing I can dump a whole album (or 5) on it should something really good come out.

It doesn't require special software to work, although it can be set up to use a sync'ing media player like WMP or Rhapsody. It recognizes M3U playlists, and most importantly of all it has auto-resume play. This is critical for me, as I use it for listening to audiobooks in the car. The resume has worked every time, even with a battery change in between listenings. It has good battery life. The screen is nicely readable in all lighting conditions. The bad: Unlike my older DNT-made players, this one doesn't understand ""folders"". It could use a little more volume. It refuses to play some of my WMA recordings. And it shipped without the software CD. (Sansa is sending a new one, supposedly.) In summary: If you want an inexpensive player and you know how to use M3U playlists, which any computer-savvy Winamp user should, this player is a good buy."

I agree with some other reviews which express dissatisfaction about some of the navigation features, but I feel this is a VERY minor problem.  The outstanding sound quality is really what makes the Sansa player THE leader among the wide selection of MP3 players in this broad consumer electronics area.  I believe that entry-level flash memory devices like this one provide a far better value for the consumer than any iPod.  Storage and retrieval of songs is just as easy and efficient.

I put the lanyard around my neck put in the earphones and listen all day at work.  I have never used the voice recorder or picture function so I only gave it 4 stars. I had my songs loaded onto it and working in 5 minutes. Only need basic windows skills to load music on it. Very easy for those of us who hate Itunes and all the nonsense of an Ipod. Sound quality is very acceptable to me. I understand I could plunk down alot more money and get a better product, but for someone who just wants something that is easy to use, low maintenance, and plays all their music I highly recommend this little guy here."
527077,A28GU9MM5HE45C,1,0,49,B000EUCMWK,3/28/2008,3,0,0,Nice should be easier to get to songs,"I got this to play music in my car and works fine for that. The battery life is pretty decent. It's easy enough to use, shouldn't need to read ""the book"". It looks good, the display is very clear, sound is good (playing through my car speakers) and it's also compact. What I think could be better: The way you store the songs is limited. It should be more flexible then what is given as choices (album, artists etc.). I pretty much just skip, skip, skip to whatever song I want. You have to go through a few menu choices before you can just play which in driving is annoying. Also, when you go to skip the first time you press a button just ""wakes"" the unit up. Kind of like moving your mouse on the computer after the screen saver kicks in. So if you want to say, skip a song, you have to press forward then forward again. All in all I like it and it suits my purposes. I listen to CD's, XM Radio and regular radio so I don't just depend on this for music. If I did I would probably go for a higher end unit. I just refuse to go iPod since they are notorious for taking over your music on your computer. All I want it do is just 'play it Sam' and the Sansa does just that."

The sound quality is great, it's easy to load songs, and it's nice to have a screen.  For some reason, I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger of a unit, but that doesn't matter at all.  It's also nice that it offers an FM radio as well (and the reception was good too!). I figure we can always upgrade from here in the future, but it IS a great product-If they won't loan me theirs, I would definately buy the same one for myself!

Compares with old cassette player (not even with the worst cd player). Battery average life was under 10 hours. Doesn't connect directly to USB (had to carry always with me the cable huge connector). Documentation is poor. It took me over 2 months of web research to find out how to create playlists (you sinply transfer the .m3u files to the root of the audible folder). Finally after 10 months the player is broken. After a media transfer with my pc it was never stopped updating the storage so the only sollution was to take out the battery. After restart the player was FROZEN with the last song played before the media transfer and the battery level on red (no control working, not even the power button).

The volumne control has been set so that they never really get very loud (headphones). It seems to be set extreamly low for some reason though. I can bearly hear it when i'm working out depending on the way the music files were saved.. i.e. low quality mp3s. but overall this MP3 is pretty good and very simple to figure out. Fairly inexpensive and large enough storage to be useful. Though memory expandability would be nice. For the price this is a very good purchase.

I've been having a problem with it lately where the back light won't work properly.  (or much at all)  It still plays fine, but the back light will flicker for a while and then not come on at all during play.  It's a bit annoying, but the songs still keep playing.  I'm an electrical engineer, so I may attempt to pull it open and take a look, but it's already small enough to require the use of a microscope.  It was never designed to play video, but having thumbnails of your kids with you in a little MP3 toy is pretty cool.  (until the back light died)"

It has some great features like the FM Radio and voice recording, SHOWS PHOTOS AND VIDEO TOO. The only downside is the antennae is in the headphones so you have to use the ones that come with the unit, and they work well, don't get me wrong. I do see tons of other varieties in the store though so I wanted to let you in on that fact.

I was able to put all their children's music and more on the player.  At just a fraction of the cost of my 1st 1GB iPod Nano, my kids could have easy access to just as much music (and even little picture...which they love).  The c14o players are very easy to load and update (just drag and drop), small yet well built, battery changes are a snap, and well designed navigational features.   I did a lot of comparison shopping, and these Sansa c140's are a great deal as long as they last for a few years or more, when the kids are likely to upgrade to another model.

Same songs play fine in other players. Thumbnails of photos load very easily thanks to the included software. Amazon claims the screen is TFT. Well, that's news to me. Nowhere does SanDisk make this claim on the packaging or on the install CD. Comparisons to STN and TFT screens on other players lead me to believe that the screen is STN. Or maybe DSTN. No way is it TFT. This player is new and already being discounted heavily. You may want to wait for the right deal or splurge for the higher end Sansa E series which is a much better investment."

Battery life is abysmal - I took it on a flight to Seoul (12 hours) and chewed through 3 Duracells.  One problem may be that the backlight turns on (seemingly at random) at the beginning of some songs, and there doesn't appear to be a way to turn this off.  I'm on my second unit and it appears to be no better. Audible functionality is also limited.  It has no bookmark function (although it does remember your last place in a file).  And the FF/Rew functionality is terrible - the file moves ~1 second per second of button press for the first 10 seconds, than advances at ~1 minute per second of button press.  There's no way to easily back up 10 or so seconds in the event e.g. you miss a word. And even though this device has been out for a while, Sundisk has no FW updates on their web site, making me wonder whether these problems will be fixed.

I used it about 10 hours a week when I am excercising. always had issues when I was trying to load songs on it, sometimes i would have to clear the player and reload all the playlists just to add five or six new songs, so it was a hassle then it broke then customer service blew me off, so much for the warranty when it keeps breaking every few months. at least they put their name on their products so I know not to buy them."

Being an audiophile, I'm a little disappointed in the sound quality, not that it's bad, it just doesn't equal my iRiver T30 or my HP 5700 PDA for clarity, both of which cost more so the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. I love the navigations on this unit; very easy to select songs, settings, FM radio. One thing to note is that right out of the box the unit is configured in the settings for ""normal"" volume range. I point this out because I think many who have bought this probably thought the audio level it puts out is too low. When selecting the ""high"" volume range, suddenly there is more than enough level for any situation. The earphones that come with the unit are good, but I have very sensitive ears (skin) which can not tolerate this type. After 20 minutes of these in my ears I'm in painful agony. I always end up using a different set of earphones like the Sennheiser CX300 which have a soft insert and great sound. Given the price, I think it deserves 4 stars."
527023,A1656IZQUXTCRN,0,0,70,B000EUJ1Q0,8/2/2007,2,6,6,Frozen after a week,"I ordered this player and it was great for about a week and then it froze when I turned it on. The company that sells it, TIGERDIRECT, has not responded to my emails so I went directly to SanDisk. SanDisk gave me a promt response and sent me a label to return the product with free shiping. Another bad thing about this player is that it organizes your music in it's own way and has trouble figuring out artists even if you have the artists name on the song."
527022,A157QHNM2RDQC7,0,0,69,B000EUJ1Q0,5/8/2007,3,6,6,Mediocre in all ways...,"The most important thing about this unit is that the audio quality is medicore at best.  The little unit just does not put out much power, and the bass tends to distort.  Note that I am using the same headphones that I was with my last unit, and RCA (which broke), and the RCA sounded much better with more volume. Second thing is the way this thing organizes the music.  It goes strictly by the tags in the MP3 files.  Don't even bother organizing your files into directories, as you cannot choose to play only one directory.  This does give you a lot of power if you are the type of person who makes sure that the tags are organized in your collection.  However, one of my favorite artists is sometimes listed as ""Echoing Green, The"" and in other places as ""Echoing Green"".  So I cannot choose to shuffle their songs even though they are all in the same directory. Also, this unit uses a power-hungry color LCD screen.  I suppose this is useful for showing pictures, but this is a feature that I don't need.  Because of this, the LCD goes blank after a few seconds.  In order to even see what song is playing, you have to hit some buttons. Finally, no type of arm band or belt clip was included in my package.  The only thing that I got was a neck strap. On the plus side, it does work, it gets decent battery life (if you leave the LCD off), holds 2G, and you should be able to find it for a decent price if you watch the sales."

At the time of my purchase, it was one of the only players that was compatible with audible.com and allowed use of AAA batteries (needed for camping and extended travel).  The battery life was disappointing as others have noted.  Because I listen to books on tape, I have an accurate measure of battery life -- about 10 hours.  Nevertheless, I would still recommend this product for those needing a player with replaceable batteries, as few alternatives exist.  A second disappointment was the extremely slow fast forward speed for non-audible.com files.  The FM tuner works OK for stronger local stations."

Price was way better here at Amazon, btw.  Anyway, I have MP3 players from iRiver (the 5 gig hard drive model), Samsung (the venerable YP-MT6 they are no longer making but was fabulous), and my wife has Ipod mini. This device from SanDisk easily sounds the worst of any of these, and has the lowest quality build (at least by feeling of flimseyness.  I only got it because it would work with Audible, but the device itself is so inferior to any or all of these other devices in sound quality, it's really rather striking.  Otherwise, it does seem to do what it's supposed to do--just does not sound well with music doing it.  Really, iRivers sound SO much better, it's not funny."

I loaded some pictures on it, but they were so small, I don't think that anyone could see them.  I do have to say that the sound is good on this.  I have other Sandisk players and once you set the radio presets, you didn't have to go through every number on the dial.  With this player you have to press it and go through every station to get to the one you want.  I called Sandisk to ask them about it.  They were very helpful and even went and got a plyer to try and figure it out.  He said that this player didn't have that like my other ones.  I ened up returning this because I do listen to a lot of radio, and I didn't want to be flipping and pressing the buttons that many times.  I ended up getting the m250 (I think).  It also has 2GB, and you can preset the radio stations, which is a must for me.  For around the same price, don't get this one, go for the m250."
527012,A3MDJ7K1UO6U3N,0,1,59,B000EUJ1Q0,11/23/2007,2,3,3,Problems not often explained with these,"Overall it does what it is supposed to do: play music. The sound quality is neither bad or exceptional and a few issues with the device may crop up. I received this product during the holidays of `06 and I've already had to replace the earphones twice--which already, regardless were taken care of and treated carefully. The volume doesn't go up very high and music can be difficult or impossible to hear in public places--stores, on the street, and rather quiet places where people are just talking normally. Scratches will develop on the face of the plastic shell over time, it's unavoidable, and will obstruct the view of the screen to an extent. The software is pretty basic, albeit a little difficult to use. Using the player itself can become a hassle. I have yet to figure out how to manage and rename songs, or for that matter find them. The player has its own ideas about organization and titles. At times it resembles trying to find a needle in a haystack, particularly if you want a certain song. The alphabetical listing is odd. If you add full albums, I've found that it will add numbers in front of the titles and therefore get shuffled around in a nonsensical manner. Finding an artist presents itself with its own problems. Often one artist will be split with 2+ names and the songs will be scattered under all of them--making you check all of them for whatever song or playlist you want. The deletion is done on the computer as is the sorting--if you can find a way to manage it. The recorder on the machine is unforgiving with mistakes. If you record something and later realize that you have an emergency lecture or whatnot, you're out of luck if you already have the space filled. It doesn't seem to matter much anyway--you need to be under supreme conditions to catch anything clearly. Radio clarity however is quite nice and I tend to use it more than listen to the 400+ songs housed there. In regards to the pictures...the screen is so small that it's completely worthless and space wasting to house them to view. Transferring files however and you won't have a problem. The worst aspect of this product however is the battery life. One AAA battery and at best you have a few hours of power for the player. The rate it goes through them is phenomenal. I've found I've even spent roughly $30 in batteries during a month--almost the price of the player itself. It truly is terrible. 15 hours of power is an absurdly exaggerated claim. So unless you can afford hundreds of batteries, the player is quite worthless owning. The amount spent on the AAAs will quickly become more expensive than a more pricely player---which might be wise to get instead of this, if price is an issue. But for its credit--It does play songs and I have yet for a song to skip, even when jogging. The color screen is nice and I'd assume the 2GB is attractive and eyecatching for something this cheap. And yes, the capability is a plus. But the player has been poorly designed, thought out, and is quite frankly a time and money sucker. So please be warned and think out the decision before investing in one of these."

It`s one of those players that relies way too much on ID3 tags instead of letting me organize the music based on how I setup the folders in Explorer (meaning any song file that doesnt have an ID3 tag gets shuffled into a generic ""unknown category"") This thing also does photos but.....WHY WOULD THEY WASTE TIME WITH  THIS FEATURE!!?? THE SCREEN IS FAR TOO SMALL FOR ANY TYPE OF MEANINGFUL PHOTO BROWSING! This player could`ve worked just as well with a plain old monochrome backlit display, and it probably would`ve been even cheaper, too! As of this review, there is NO FIRMWARE update, and I`m not about to wait around for it. I`m going back to their Sandisk 1Gb player since it was so reliable to begin with.

The file system used by the player is intuitive, and works well for me, (I tend put entire albums on, instead of individual songs) and the player groups them by artist or album. There is also a GOlist function. The audio is excellent, and really is a function the ear/headphones that are hooked to it. Lastly, it uses AAA batteries, I use rechargeables.

We are still using the 1st. battery that I installed in it so the batteries last a long time. It uses a AA battery which makes it convenient.

Playlists can be created with the Rhapsody software included but the included instructions should be better for creating the playlists.  Also, when I tried to create a third playlist, one of the previous playlists didn't work.  Whether that means only two customer-created playlists are possible, I don't know.

I have loaded music, podcasts, and audio books on the device and have had no problems whatsoever. I typically only load music encoded at 192kbps or higher and the sound quality is quite acceptable.  The included earbuds don't provide the greatest sound quality, but I tried the device with some quality headphones to check quality and the player sounds completely different and very good. I have *not* experienced any ""clicking"" before or during tracks.  The only tricky thing about this unit is that it has two different transfer modes (MTP/Auto-dectect & MSC). From what I can gather, the MTP mode is good if you are using ITunes or Rhapsody or a similar subscription service.  If you wish to simply drag/drop any of your media without any licensing restrictions, this is done in MSC mode (selected under USB options on the player).  In this mode, the player functions simply like a USB flash drive on your PC, which then allows you to load up whichever files you wish to fill it up.  The device, once the USB cable is unplugged, does a little internal organizing (few seconds), and then you have full access to play any/all sound media loaded. The unit has a color LCD screen and is capable of displaying small .jpeg files, but I have not spent any time with this feature, nor do I intend to do so.  I do wish the unit would display more media info (i.e. time remaining, total time of tracks, etc.), but it does at least sort by album, artist, song titile, or genre. The battery life is somewhat less than advertised -- I am averaging about 4-5 hours of play-time. But the thing takes only one AAA battery.  I use a Lithium rechargable so it is fine for my usage. The case and buttons feel a little flimsy, but not to a degree that I think it will break under normal usage. Overall, for the price I think it is a good value.  You get 2GB of storage, drag-drop functionality (copy/paste files directly to the device) -- making this device very usable for general file storage and transfer.  With the addition of a FM Receiver/recorder and voice recording capability, you have a nice little handy unit."

The sound quality was horrible. In order to hear with the headphones, I had to turn the volume to the max. What's worse was when the player was hooked to my car stereo: even when both the player and the stereo were turned up all the way, I still couldn't hear very well. In addition to the poor sound quality, the buttons were not very responsive, as I would have to push them 3 or 4 times before anything would happen. To top it all off, two weeks after my purchase, the player stopped working all together (would power off as soon as it was turned on).

What a letdown! 1st of all, to use this while engaging in activities like running or cycling where you must have it attached via an armband, you'll need to shell out even more dough for that, as no band is included, a lanyard is included, which I consider a hazard more than help. Secondly, the maximum volume is limited due to all the hysteria surrounding hearing loss and it needs to be kept near its maximum just to be reasonably loud. If you play a file that is softer or has a wide dyn. range, you'll likely have to turn it up all the way to maximum. If Spinal Tap's amps go to 11, Sandisk's c series only goes to about 7. The usb cable is proprietary, so if you have a spare cable floating around and want to keep one at work and at home, well this just can't take advantage of that. Send more dough to get a spare cable. After 5 days, it stopped working. Tried replacing battery, wouldn't power back up. It may have gotten wet while working out (did I mention it does not come with an armband???) Brought it back and got the sandisk m230 that is being phased out to be replaced by the c series. Comes with an armband, a little protective case that mates to the armband, a standard usb cable, and it's louder (must have been introduced before the political correctness police decided we can't turn our music up anymore). I'm 41 years old, my father's going deaf, his mother was deaf as a post by the time she passed away, sometimes hearing loss has nothing to do with earbuds. Actually my hearing issues are not ear related, whole different story. The good news, nice display, great fm tuner, it take AAA's instead of some ridiculously expensive rechargeable battery, battery life was about what I expected but replacement batteries are very cheap and easily found, large capacity for the money. It's too bad, I really wanted this player to work out."

526953,A9Y53SEII1ACB,0,1,13,B000EUJJ12,11/29/2007,5,12,13,"Wow, lots of negative feedback, but nothing on the actual receiver","I see lots of low stars on this receiver, but I think it's a great receiver, from a standpoint of HD receivers.  Anytime you activate a new receiver on Directv, it does enter you into a 2 year committment, but if it's such a big deal, you can change your programming and go with a lower priced package.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but Dish Network requires an 18 month committment, so an extra 6 months means nothing to me.  The big difference is in this technology versus cable.  I used to have cable, but had trouble getting HD channels because our cable was so old (and I live in a good neighborhood).  So I made the switch to Directv and the difference in picture quality is huge.  Plus, as many football fans who subscribe to cable are painfully finding out tonight, NFL Network is only available through DBS providers.  If you own a flat panel HD TV and subscribe to Directv, this receiver is a must (outputs at the component, HDMI and optical level).  Components are good enough, as Directv hasn't started broadcasting in 1080p, only 1080i, which I believe the Dish (again correct me if I'm wrong) broadcasts as well.  Know that if you buy the receiver used you do face a risk in that if a) the receiver is used and out on lease to someone and has not been returned, directv makes you return the box to them, regardless of how you purchased it and b) if the access card has been used you have to pay for a new sealed access card from Directv - I believe $20.  Otherwise this receiver works great and if you already have Directv setup, activation is quick, just make sure that grey satellite cable to receiver converter in the back of the box is included as well or you won't be able to access some newer HD channels...unless you purchase that from them as well..."
526952,AC63924IPU3IS,0,0,12,B000EUJJ12,2/24/2008,3,4,4,No Alternative for HD on DirecTV,"I don't know about the DVR model, but you really have no other choice than to go with this receiver if you just want HD via DirecTV.  I personally hate it that there are no choices when it comes to getting satellite receivers.  The features on this receiver are rather ordinary.  I can live with that, but what drives me crazy is the lag when changing channels.  It's especially slow when going from a channel at 480p to one at 1080i.  Most people probably aren't going to be bothered by this.  As for the interface, it's rather standard fare.  You have autotuning so that the system automatically goes to a program that you select.  There's the usual interactive guide, and the ability to program favorite channels.  But there's no killer app.  Perhaps there isn't on any other service either.  It just would be nice if there were some competition.  Instead of each service competing, competition with the receivers would get us something different and perhaps faster. If you're reading this, you're probably more shopping for the service than for the receiver since you can't have one without the other.  Perhaps that's why some have decided to air their opinions of the service.  I've been a DirecTV customer for seven years and for the most part have no complaints."
526951,A29PCQFO8JCYL3,0,1,11,B000EUJJ12,4/22/2006,1,65,90,Buyer Beware,"If you're thinking of upgrading your current DirecTV HD receiver to the H20, beware!  Apparently, as I just learned, when you buy one of these, even if it's not from DirecTV directly (say at Best Buy, CompUSA, Amazon, etc), even if you hook it up yourself, you're entering into a new two-year agreement. That's right!  I bought this receiver back in January 2006 because my previous one (also HD) I'd had for about 4 years up and died.  I didn't get the HD DVR because 3 people I talked to at DirecTV said I needed a phone line for the DVR to work.  I haven't owned a land line in about 5 years, so the DirecTV HD DVR was out of the question. Well here it is in April and I've decided to go with Dish.  Dish has an HD DVR that doesn't need a phone line, plus they have at least twice the number of HD channels as DirecTV. When I called DirecTV to cancel my account, they said I owed an ""early cancellation fee"" of $262!  What?!  I explained that no, I've been a DirecTV customer for about 10 years now and that the receiver I bought in January wasn't for new service but was simply to replace the receiver that had died.  He basically said ""Sir, it's on your customer agreement that you're entering into a contract, it's on your bill, and on our website, you should read the fine print, yada yada yada."" What a load of you-know-what.  I shelled out $200 for this receiver and installed it myself.  I bought DirecTV's Early Bird NFL Sunday Ticket.  I've stuck with DirecTV for the last 10 years and this is the thanks I get?  A final slap in the face for $262? The rep tried to justify it by saying ""We have to do this in order to recoup the costs of the receiver.  Normally, without an agreement, it would cost $350."" I have two problems with that statement.  One, the HD Dish DVR costs less than $350!  How he thinks a non-DVR costs that much is beyond my comprehension.  Two, $262 != $150.  Do the math."

Just after completing 3 months warranty period, HDMI port stopped working. There was no VIDEO/AUDIO through HDMI port. Called Directv support and they said it's a known issue and they would replace it with a refurbished one. But the twist was I had to extend my contract for another two years to get the faulty receiver replaced. Which sounded ridiculous. I decided to use Component Cables for viewing 1080i instead of HDMI. I regret for switching from Comcast to Directv. I don't want to get stuck with Directv due to faulty receivers.

The replacement was an H21. For those who don't know, The H20 has an Off-The-Air antenna connector on the back and the receiver merged the Off-The-Air Digital channels in with the Directv channels on the channel guide. It was great. Anyway the H21 does not have an Off-The-Air antenna connection. As a result the only local Off-The-Air digital channels I can get come in by sattelite. Again for those who don't know, the local TV stations can broadcast multiple digital channels for every analog channel. So, what you see for local HD channels on Directv is only a fraction of what is actually being broadcast Over-The-Air locally. Anyway. I want my H20 back. It was so nice to have ALL of my local Off-The-Air channels merged in with my directv channel guide. Andy"

The unit would overheat and reset itself.  Since having that unit replaced with an H20-100 model, I've experienced no issues at all!  The HD picture, via MPEG-2 and newer MPEG-4 signals, is beautiful.  I'd seen a friends HD picture with Comcast and, while admittedly an isolated comparison, concluded that DirecTV's HD picture is - far & away - superior. I've been with DirecTV for over 10 years now and wouldn't even consider going back to cable.  Their customer service is first rate - although I find I rarely have to call them.

They brag about their ""digital picture and sound,"" and their great customer service. The truth is the only way to get digital picture and sound is with a HDTV and an HDMI.  Their picture is actually worse than the picture we got with Comcast.  Not to mention there is no two year agreement with cable, no picture loss when it rains, you do not have to pay for ""leased equipment, and you do not need an ugly dish hanging on your house. When we purchased our most recent HDTV, we figured we would replace the DVR we had with DirecTV and get an HD DVR to replace it. DirecTV told us we would have to pay $299 for the privlige of leasing their receiver from them.  In addition to this we would have to pay $50 because we were a new customer ""and had not established a credit history with them.""  Also, we would have to pay $20 for shipping and handling and extend our contract for another two years. Maybe DirecTV thinks it is in the cellphone business because all they want to do is lock you into long-term contracts and make you bleed money for them forever.  Their symbol should be a ball and chain because that is what they really are.  Cable here I come!"

Plug in the USB, plug in the power, and you're ready to transfer files. The included Google software and Western Digital's back-it-up program is also optional. The box doesn't even have a cd for installation. You just plug it into the computer and you'll find the software on the drive itself. It's a beautiful little black box with two blue led rings on the front. The outer ring consists of four LED's that flash in a clockwise direction as you read or write data to the drive. The inner ring consists of six LED's that display how much of the drive is being used up. The back contains one usb port and two firewire ports. The top and bottom have two black rubber borders that grip any surface pretty well and they contain exhaust vents which were made with looks in mind. Finally, when Western Digital says quiet operation, they MEAN quiet operation. This hard drive makes absolutely no noise at all. Not on spin-up, nor while you're using it. The last great feature is that it detects when your computer is on or off so it will turn itself on and off as well. Great product!"

526936,A36Y5UJ9YDPEK,0,0,34,B000EVMK5S,2/5/2007,5,8,9,An excellent choice for an external hard drive,"There are numerous external hard drives for sale. I looked at some of them and concluded that WD's My Book is the best choice for me. Using with XP SP2. Pros: 1) I believe this is the best-looking external drive out there. I don't buy products solely based on looks, but I do think My Book's case design is elegant. It goes well with my black ThinkPad and I happen to have a USB hub that also glows in blue, so they complement each other well. 2) It is a plug-n-play device. It feels to me that WD's engineers worked hard to make the experience as easy as they can think of. The first time I plugged it in to my USB hub, the drive automatically started its initial configuration, which I declined because I already had other backup software and search utility (both included with My Book), but for someone new to computers, I don't know what could be simpler. Everything you need to use My Book with either a Windows machine or a Mac is included. 3) It is competitively priced. I went with My Book Premium Edition instead of Essential Edition (cheaper than many other drives with similar capacities) because it has both USB and Firewire connections. I plan to have this drive for a while and maybe I may use it with a Mac in the future. 4) I like WDC's support. For example, the included manual has instructions on how to convert from FAT32 to NTFS. Yeah, geeky, but the fact this is included in the manual as well as relevant FAQs on the web site (like restoring My Book's icon in Explorer after you format the drive) sealed the deal for me. 5) The best thing about My Book: I do very much like the feature that it turns off itself when the computer is shut down. I cannot find any other external drive that does this. It also has an extra protection built in not to shut it down while the data are being written to the device. That's intelligent and user friendly. It's quiet too. Cons: I read reviews that this drive is slow when writing data. I do not feel that it's slow. Your mileage may vary. All in all, the elegance, price, and WD's support make My Book Premium my choice for an external hard drive!"

As the prices for these drives continue to fall, since larger drives (500 GB as well as even 1000 GB) are now available, they really are a good buy and an excellent way to externally store as well as transfer data. My experience is that this drive is very easy to install, reformat, and use as an extra drive. No problems. The only thing I really don't like is the fact that it doesn't have a real on/off button. The circle on the front does turn off the power, but whenever the computer starts, this drive starts as well. That means that unless the drive is manually turned off after the computer starts, the drive will always be on when the computer is on. I prefer to have the drive on only when I need it to save it from unnecessary wear and tear. Other external drives from Maxtor and even other Western Digital drives have real on/off switches.

You can't chalk this up to user error because I own an identical drive and troubleshooted everything on both drives (cross-testing them on different computers, tested the cables, power supplies, etc. etc.) and no dice - it's the ports. One faulty drive I'd chalk up to bad luck, but twice in a row is no coincidence.

The USB port worked OK, but it was pretty slow (FireWire is faster than USB for large data transfers), so I exchanged this drive for another of the same model, thinking the odds that two drives would both have malfunctioning ports would be pretty slim.

After plugging it in (if Autoplay is enabled) it will run its preinstalled script and start the setup process.  It comes bundled with Mac/PC proggies and drivers, but if you accidentally wipe everything, you can redownload them all from the WD site simply by providing the product SN. I've stopped using the Firewire Port - it was nice that they bundled a cable, but the transfers were too flaky - not sure if the problem was on their end or my pc's, but my other PC doesn't have FW for me to check out. Anyhow, with nothing installed, and USB, it's still plug and play and going strong after two years. Slow, yes - it's USB, which eats up CPU, versus Firewire, which does not - I'd prefer the firewire, but it would frequently be dysfunctional on my PC, requiring a reboot. I make a lot of use of the ""button manager"" to turn the device on and off (it's software driven), which may be the culprit behind the FW problems, I'd either have to go into hardware manager and ""rescan"" or simply reboot if I powered it down.  That's not the case with USB tho.  The button manager isn't needed tho - it's fully functional (just can't be powered off by pushing a button).  Shutting the PC down will shut it down at the same time, button manager or not. All that angst aside, I dropped the (faster for big transfers) FW for the USB, and it's working just fine.  No fan means it's quiet.  It does get warm, but not hot. My other complaint is the black paint is ""oily finger"" unfriendly.  My fingerprints are ""etched"" onto it now. Trivial, but the cooling vents are actually cut in morse code (dots and dashes, with spaces) for something (I've not decoded it yet, lol).  This is true for all the MyBook series.

You have to do a time-consuming restart to coax it to reappear on your desk-top, in the meantime amusing yourself with the flickering blue light of its iris-shaped ""on"" button. When I see all of the negative reviews for drives--from external storage drives to DVD players--I'm about to establish a company that uses nothing but magnetic tape reels. If operations like Library of Congress, NASA and the CIA are dependent on information stored on computer hard drives, heaven help us.

The BAD: (1) the drive does make some noise at times, not really expected from WD stuff (have had other of their products in the past, no complaints), (2) you cannot 'disconnect' the drive from XP at least 9 out of 10 times, as the drive still runs even though you're long done accessing it. I've tried to let it run to see if it would stop by itself and 30 mins. later, had to boot off my laptop before unplugging this thing...

I only powered up this drive once every two weeks for maybe an hour at a time, to back up my files, and I've only owned it for a little more then a year. The other day, I came into my room and it smelled of something burning. I finally traced it to the hard drive where the green light was blinking on and off intermittently. Mind you, the hard drive was OFF. Somehow the power supply shorted and the connection between the power supply plug where it enters the hard drive was extremely hot; when I touched it, I thought I'd burned myself, it was so hot. I was gone all day, so I have no idea how long it was sitting there just burning away. The drive is dead, WD will not do anything about it since their warranty started almost FOUR MONTHS before I had actually purchased it since it is from the date of manufacture. What a TERRIBLE, AWFUL, FRAUDULENT rip off. They have lost me as a customer. They shouldn't be allowed to mark the drive with a manufacturing date and then spend the time to ship it to a store where it sits in the stock room or warehouse for an unknown amount of time before it makes it to the shelf. The REAL warranty, therefore is only six to eight months. Unacceptable. They will not take responsibility. Also unacceptable. A lot of people are reporting failure after only a year of use, including burning of the drive. I find that awfully suspicious? Don't you? You have lost me as a customer! Do not purchase!"

PQ  2 year warranty Firewire this TV is the reference standard for others to follow!,"After reading many reviews at the AVS CRT forums I decided to buy this TV. It has been discontinued and the replacment model XBR 970 does not have the super fine picture tube, or fire wire. I was blown away when I saw it on the show room floor. One thing I noticed is they usally keep the CRTs away from the expensive high end Plasma and LCD TVs. After you see this TV you will know why. The PQ from this 34"" CRT is simply breath taking. HD content is stunning! The fact that it comes with a Two Year Parts and Labor IN HOME WARRANTY really makes this TV a real bargin. One really nice feature is the built in iLink port aka 4-pin firewire. With this port you are able to hook the TV to your Mac and record Digital and HD content. Search for VirtualDVHS for more info. You will need to get a 4pin/6pin firewire cable and some free software from Apple SDK. I have not done this yet as I am waiting for my firewire cable but I am looking forward to playing back HD movie trailers From my Intel Imac to this TV. The only negative is it is Heavy! You will need at least two people to move it. Not a big deal really, when I think back how many times I needed to move my CRT TVs around in the last 20 years. For me it is a non issue. If your the type of person that moves every 6 months, you may want to reconsider. My last Sony XBR TV went 18 years with out a single issue. I Hope the KD34XBR960N will last me a long time. Since this TV is dicontinued there are some incredible bargins to be had so don't wait too long as this is trully one of the really great TVs out there and they are becoming scarce."

Both told me that the problem is with the card and not the camera.  Apparently, the card can have formatting problems when it is exposed to ""extreme temperatures"" and can't be used to take more pictures until it is reformatted.  Reformatting causes all pictures on the card to be lost, so I had the option of taking no more pictures for the day or deleting the pictures I had just taken so that I can take more (I didn't have an extra card with me).  On all three occassions, the camera was with me in an air conditioned car or outside in 80 degree weather.

Filling a 4GB stick with music and movies can take a while, but it takes a bit less time with this SanDisk model.

The upgrade in speed is even more noticeable when I hook up the camera to my PC to download the photos.  The percentage increase in speed is tough to gauge over the previous card, but I'd guess it to be as much as 50% in some cases (which makes sense when you consider the specified read/write speed).  I reckon I can put between 1100 and 1200 photos on the card at full 8MP resolution.  This is more than enough for any trip.

It is based on the initial setup and understanding of it. I didn't expect to start taking ""amazing"" photos the first night that I used the CCD camera, even though I have read reviews and seen the photos of people doing just that. But, I was still surprised at the total lack of documentation and basic guidance that is included with this equipment. They don't even give you the basic information on how to install the filters in the filter holder much less any technical info needed to run the software. Sure trial and error works but you shouldn't have to rely on that especially considering the cost for this product. From what I've read about this CCD camera it is possible to get some great shots with it and I'm sure that I eventually will get them.

Creating colour images by combining Red, Green, Blue and luminance monochrome images takes time and effort, but the results are worth the extra work.  Meade also sells a one shot colour version of the DSI II which may be a better choice as a first CCD camera.  If you have the patience though, you will get noticeably better images using the monochrome DSI Pro II and filters. I would highly recommend that you pick up a decent image processing package such as Photoshop, Paintshop Pro or similar to get the most out of the final images."

But if you have no experience with astrophotography, plan to spend many, many hours before you'll get anything reasonable, and pretty much forget taking pictures of moon / planets (in all fairness, it is a Deep Space Imager...). Meade does a very poor job of explaining what some of the controls do (histogram, offset - you can slide them around but what do they actually do? Don't ask the manual). Focusing is still a problem (despite a software focusing assist included - it's pretty much useless). In addition the camera does really poorly in high contrast situations. All in all, it's too late for me to send it back which I'm really sorry about - I kept it too long trying to master it, now I guess I have to :-)"
526809,A3E3T8MS11VGKP,0,0,2,B000EXAO4K,4/6/2006,5,7,7,"Because when you need a light, you need light!","I've owned a Fenix L0P for months now, and let me say, it is a true 5 star product. Not just because I say so, but because two independant flashlight review sites say so as well. This little AAA wonder light is 30 lumens strong.  That's nearly twice as bright as a 2 D-cell flashlight at 16 lumens, and 25% more light than a 3 D-cell Maglite at 24 lumens. Plus it is white light, not that yellowish light with the broken light ring and donut shape. If you are thinking a Maglite Solitaire with AAA is just as good, you are dead wrong. A Solitaire is 4 to 6 lumens at best.  By the time battery half life comes around, you are looking at 2 or 3 lumens. If 6 lumens doesn't impress you, how will 3 impress you, let alone be useful? The Fenix also has a circuit regulator to keep the light more  consistent as the battery weakens,  draining it much more deeply.  I drained a AAA in a Solitaire and it took about 2:30 minutes before the light went out. Not to mention the light output was useless in the last 30 minutes or so. I measured the battery which was now about 1.0 ~ 1.2 volts and 250 mA. Technically dead as far as the Solitaire goes.  I dropped it in the Fenix and it still gave off very usable light. I'm talking enough light to navigate in the dark and read by. It stayed lit for several hours on this pathetic battery and at the end it was very dim, even the mighty Fenix can't get blood from a stone dead battery. Rule of thumb, if you can no longer navigate a dark place with the light output, change the battery. When a Fenix light is dim you KNOW the battery is truly sucked dry. By using a rechargeable NiMH battery, you will get a flatter discharge curve, making the light more consistant as the battery drains. It's just the nature of NiMH. However, because it has a steep self discharge rate, don't consider using it as a standby light because it can be dead in a few months. Many have used Lithium AAA's for brighter light and longer run times. In all, you have a quality product.  The Type III coating is stronger than the Type II you find on Maglites.  The lens is glass with anti-reflective coating, and the reflector dish is polished metal.  The near indestructable LED bulb has a 100,000 hour life, giving you 10+ years of loyal service. Stop cheating yourself and buy a Fenix. Because when you need a light, you need light!"

I have been using this lens for about a month now and I the only complaint i have is minimal ghosting in direct sunlight. this is easily cured with a well placed hand. I can block all ghosting without getting my hand in the picture even at 12mm. i dont use the lens hood, so I dont know how effective it is. this lens is large and it will cause horrible shadows with the built in flash or an attached speedlight. it will also cause shadows while in commander mode with a wireless set up. this is not a concern for me. I simply hold my speedligh in front of my built in flash in commander mode when ever I need a flash. I have used a nomal thickness UV filter with this lens (hoya 77mm) and i could see no distortion at all at any settings.  I am a diehard nikkor fanantic, however, I am very impressed with this lens.

All my other lenses are Canon L -- and this one keeps right up with them. The ability to go super-wide (past 17mm) is a lot of fun -- -enables a lot of creative shots and adds a great sense of depth to landscapes. I have compared the Tokina directly to the Sigma 12-24 and Canon 10-20mm lenses. I thought the Sigma was nearly as good in picture quality, but not nearly as well built as the Tokina. The Sigma may have even been a touch sharper, but the color saturation and slight warmth of the Tokina create strikingly beautiful images with very little retouching. The Tokina lens is nearly all metal with great grippy dials -- the Canon and Sigma are mostly constructed of plastic. I also liked that the Tokina is a fixed f4 in aperture - enabling more flexibility in exposure. The Sigma is only f4 at 12mm, and then you lose a stop to f5.6 if you zoom in at all -- requiring more light for the same exposure. The extra 2mm of vantage that the Canon 10-20mm provides (over the 12-24mm Sigma and Tokina) is attractive, but I thought the barrel distortion (""fisheye"" effect) was pretty pronounced between 10-12 mm. It's not too tough to fix the distortion in photoshop -- but considering the significant extra expense for the Canon and the great images I got out of the Tokina I decided to stick with the Tokina tank. Only downside of Tokina is that the autofocus is slow -- but I rarely am trying to catch anything in motion with a super-wide angle lens anyway. Anyway -- even from a Canon L devotee, I say this lens is a 6 out of 5. Especially when you take the price into consideration -- worth every penny.

OH MAN do i love it. sturdier than the 24-85 and significantly less bulky than the 16-35, i find it sharper than either lens at any aperture. the manual focus ring is nice and tight and because the zoom element is internal, it does not slide when pointed down. the auto focus is a touch noisy, but pretty quick and accurate. over all, it is very well built. not to mention, the super wide angle makes excellent and interesting images. it is great for landscape photography and close-up portraits, among many other things. i definitely recommend this lens. it is well worth the money."

WARNING: It has NEVER happened to me when using registry mechanic. But here is my 02 CENTS! First of all, before doing any sort of cleanup or repair, make sure you do a registry backup. Just go into registry mechanic's options and place a checkmark on the option that reads,""create a system restore point......."" It is always nice to have a known good, working copy of your registry. Since you never know what or when it could get corrupted. Now, for the program itself. I have used it since version 3. Have used with several different pc makes and models. Always worked as advertised. Never messed anything up. In addition to keeping the registry clean, make sure you keep your pc cleaned of junk files. I suggested cleanup40.exe or ccleaner; both free. It goes without saying, but, you should have a good anti-virus program (and keep it updated). Also, you should have 2 good anti-spyware (anti-malware) programs.

He was able to get most, but not all removed.  I then downloaded Spybot Search & Destroy and installed this program.  Much to my relief, I was able to remove all of the Trojans and clean up my registry, resulting in faster computer performance.  This program is easy to use and I highly recommend it.  Regarding the reviewer who advises not to buy the product, I wonder if he did not create a system restore point before compacting the registry.  It is vital to create a system restore point whenever making changes to the registry, just in case the changes cause a problem with computer performance.

I installed them all at the same time so I can't be sure exactly which program (if indeed it's just one) is causing me so many problems.  What I can tell you is this: prior to installing this company's software, I had issues with my system working sluggishly, and I suspected I had some spyware ""infections"".  While the software indicates it has cleaned and repaired my system and quarantined this virus or that, overall my computer works worse than ever!  Web pages take forever to open.  I also have a new problem: an inability to view many images on the web.  Instead, I see the little white box with the red ""X"" at the center where a picture should be.  I suspect my software may be blocking the downloading of these images and probably can be adjusted to allow those downloads, but the answer to how to do this is not obvious.  There's no easy-to-find, user-friendly panel where I can simply click a box and override the blocking of pictures, for example.  The company's web site is dreadfully unhelpful.  First, it does not make a customer service phone number readily available.  It wants you to submit your request for help via an e-mail form.  I've done this twice and received no assistance or helpful information whatsoever.  This e-mail form system is flawed anyway because it requires you to select from only ONE software product with which to get help.  What if, as in my situation, you purchased more than one product and you don't know which one's causing the problem?  Furthermore, instead of offering a thorough page of answers to frequently asked questions, the site provides a forum (message board) for lost souls like me to go into so we can try to get the answers from EACH OTHER.  It seems PCTools expects us to stumble around their products helplessly and do the job of customer service for them -- that is, IF we've managed to trip over an answer to our problem in the first place.  Some of us are still out here floating in space.  Oh, and that forum?  I tried to register for it but PCTools has yet to e-mail me the necessary confirmation that allows me to get into it and use it -- so even its lame forum remains useless to me. Is anybody HOME at PCTools?  I don't think so.  If you're lucky enough to have this product work for you perfectly out of the box with no quirks, you're on Easy Street.  If you have any issues whatsoever, you're up the creek.  You'll be stuck with useless software you'll wish you'd never bought in the first place, with problems that tragically can probably be easily solved, but with no one home to help you solve them. This is my honest review -- take it for what you think it's worth.  You're probably better off hiring a reputable computer person to physically come to your home or office and diagnose your problems, and to be there to answer your questions on the spot, than to expect a lifeless disk or download to make your system better. Nice try, PC Tools -- but try again."

It is a good size for tooling around town doing my daily activities.  I like this pack and prefer it over the larger packs. It provides decent padding to protect my electronic and optical gear.  I'm not a professional photographer so I don't really need to carry gobs of optical equipment.  I just like having my Canon 5D attached to my EF 24-105mm f/4 L with me and my EF 16-35mm f/2.8L on deck.  My 11"" sony VAIO (with verizon card for internet access) fits nicely and is well protected and there is still room enough for paperwork and small misc items.  My treo 650 on my hip and I'm totally geeked out.  I actually walk around all day like this being very productive and able to do some enjoyable things during my limited down times.  Sometimes I find it amazing how much technology I actually like having with me...SCARY.  But, I enjoy it and this set up lets me capture pics throughout my day whenever I find a good opportunity.  Sometimes I just shoot to help my increasing dementia for later reference :). The pack looks nice and simple and doesn't attract too much attention (which I like).  Some of the pakcs out there are pretty ""flashy"" and most do not do as good of a job with padding and protection.  Of course you still shouldn't throw the pack down or kick it around but you shouldn't do that with ANY of the soft packs and I'd still wouldn't do that with a pelican or any of the hard cases. Excellent ""normal"" looking pack.  Can carry a good amount of equipment comfortably.  Not weather proof but that's ok with me.  Excellent protection.  Comfortable for a day pack.  Can't think of much wrong with the pack except the weather proofing part and that didn't really matter to me so I'm giving the thing five stars."

The camera area is easy to access and has room for my Canon 30D with a fairly large lens attached, plus space for additional lenses. I also put the power transformer for my MacBook Pro in the camera section. The computer section held my MacBook Pro 17"" laptop very well.  One trip I also put a 15"" HP in the note pocket of the computer area. Of course that made the backpack very heavy. I'm very careful with setting the bag down.  It bothers me a little that the camera is on the bottom of the pack.  The more expensive Lowepro bags center the camera in the pack, but they are much larger than I wanted to carry."

I searched for hours, on every site, for the perfect bag. I looked for something girlie, but not too girlie. I'm glad I settled on this bag. I'm little, not even 5' tall, this hits me right at my tailbone. I measured a backpack I used a few years ago on me and this one is perfect. I wanted to be able to take my laptop with me to parties and events as well as have room for other things besides my camera. It's a lot lighter than I expected even with the bottom filled with camera stuff, a speed light, extra batteries, etc., personal items and the laptop. I have a 12"" Gateway wide screen and it fits perfectly in there. I love that I can listen to my iPod while wearing the pack. The shoulder straps are well padded and so is the part that you wear next to your spine. VERY comfortable! I will use this often as I take photos around the city and photograph parties and events. Everything is in one place with room leftover! I would like to have double zippers on the middle (main) pocket, but I will learn to live with one.

I didn't want an ugly camera bag or an ugly laptop bag and then I found this bag on amazon.com.  WOW.  I found it at a local store (paid more, but I needed it right way) and loved it at first sight. The camera section is very versatile... you can rearrange the little velcro tabs to fit different camera/lens combinations.  I can fit my Olympus E-500 with the 14-45mm lens attached (with a UV filter and circular polarizer), my 40-150mm lens, both lens hoods a cleaning cloth and lenscaps.  When I get a macro lens, I think it will fit in there, too, but that'll be it. The laptop compartment fits my 15"" macbook pro perfectly.  I have a sleeve for it that I keep inside the bag for extra padding, but I don't think it needs it.  There's more vertical room, too, so I'm sure most of the 17"" laptops would work. My favorite part of the bag is the accessory section.  I keep my earbuds in there with pens, the power cord for my laptop, the USB cable for my camera and many books.  There's PLENTY of room in there, and if you have extra camera lenses with their own padded containers, you could definitely fit some in here. I also love the little ipod pocket.  Again, I have a sleeve for that, and the ipod and sleeve fit in there perfectly. The backpack handles are very comfortable... and the green and black colors look very contemporary.  I'd recommend this to anyone!  :)"

I will be able to make it onto the plane with just the one carryon -- not even a purse! -- so I can be (as) sure (as possible) that I'll keep everything with me. Also?  With the sporty gray color block, it's more attractive than a lot of similar bags, *and* it costs less than most of them, as well. Size might be an issue for a big person, but I'm 5'3"", and the  straps fit my shoulders very comfortably.  I feel sporty and cool, wearing my jaunty little backpack. Color me pleased."
526752,AN1S0WXJI4N1Q,0,0,72,B000EY1LCI,7/5/2006,5,8,9,Very Convenient,"I just recieved this bag today. I'm posting under this one only because this is the color I got, however it should be the same for the other 2 colors. I'm planning to use it in a real situation in the beginning of August when I go on my trip, but I can give a short review on my initial testings today. There are 3 main compartments; laptop, daypack, and slr. the laptop is against ur back, the slr is at the bottom, and the daypack is the area between the 2. there's a fair amount of padding as well only around the laptop and slr compartment. i wouldn't drop the bag too hard, but setting it down in a normal manner isn't a bad idea. the laptop compartment is made to fit a laptop. the padding makes it hard to stretch out in case you wanted to fit something thicker in there. i fit my widescreen laptop in there, which is 1.75 inches thick and 17 inches diagonal corner-to-corner. the fit is very very snug. there's also a strip of detachable padding at the bottom. not sure why. maybe to sit over the top? but i didn't see any velcro near the top for it to attach to though. after putting the laptop in, there's very little room over the top of it. there's also a sleeve in there. for smaller laptops, there may be room for the laptop to slide around in. regardless, if you have a small laptop in there and are wearing the backpack, then the laptop is being pulled against your back, so i'm sure it won't move around very much. the slr compartment is very well padded. the reason i would still be careful about setting the bag down is because the slr is at the bottom. there are detachable velcro walls, 5 pieces. i fit my tiny rebel xt in there, but after that, maybe only enough room for a few more small lenses or a flash. after putting the xt in, there's probably room for a longer zoom lens. with all these different shaped pieces, you could also put in some of your own padding; pieces of small clothing or something, or bubblewrap. on the outside of this compartment, there are 2 small pockets on either side. now the daypack compartment is impressive. there are many pockets in this part. the pockets come in different sizes. and the outside of this compartment is not padded, however whatever is in there is sitting against 2 walls of padding. maybe good enough for your laptop equipment. now on the outside of the daypack, there's another smaller zippered pocket. this is sized for your portable media player (ipod or something similar). there's also a hole that you can feed your headphones through. again, you may be worried because there's no padding in there. you can't fit anything wider than 3 inches and longer than 5 inches. it was a great fit for my cowon a2 portable media player. again, if you're worried about anything, you could put more padding in the daypack compartment. as for the arm straps, they fit very comfortabely; adjustable of course. and there aren't any other straps to be found around the bag. the material seems very durable, although i'm no expert in this area. so anyway, for the price, this bag is very very convenient. it fits a bunch of things very safely. with the padding on the bottom, it sits up on its own."
526751,A1T8UP1R6SBUIV,0,0,71,B000EY1LCI,5/29/2006,5,5,5,"This could finally be ""The Perfect Bag""","As every photographer knows, finding the perfect bag for every situation is most likely the hardest thing to do, even harder than choosing camera equipment like bodies or lenses. When I stumbled upon this bag, I knew I had to order one. At $79.95, it's not cheap, granted, but it _is_ Lowepro, a well-known and quality brand. The construction is great, and the backpack can withstand quite a beating. The bag has three pockets, one for a notebook, one for accessories and other goodies, and a bottom pocket for a body or two, a couple of lenses, and a flash. Lowepro's literature says that the notebook compartment can hold up to a 17"" notebook, and indeed, it holds both my VAIO FS950 15.4"" and my MacBook Pro 15"" quite well(not at the same time, of course). At any given time, I'll have books, food, 10 or more rolls of film, my PSP and/or DS, Holga(for those of you who don't know what this is, it's a Hong Kong-made toy camera that takes 120 roll film), and my notebook, of course. In the bottom pocket, both my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT and my EOS Elan 7ne fit, along with the 17-40mm f/4L, the 50mm f/1.8, and the Speedlite 430EX. The bag handles this all very well. On the recent trip to Asia(one situation where it was good to have a non ""Burnt Orange"" bag that would atract attention walking through Bangkok), the pack felt great walking around for extended periods with that load, and fit right under the seat on the plane, a plus, because are you _really_ going to let your precious cheetos, cameras, and notebook even one inch out of your sight? Overall, a great bag for travelers and day-hikers."

I have an HP 17"" widescreen laptop, which I didn't think would fit, but I checked a local store and found the inside dimensions listed for the laptop compartment. I measured my machine, and it seemed perfect, but I missed one detail: the laptop is rectangular, perfectly so, and the laptop compartment is not. the full length of the laptop compartment is, indeed, long enough for my 17"" to fit, but the corners are rounded at the top of the bag, and my laptop is not. therefor, no luck. but I still give it 4 out of 5 because the camera compartment is excellent and there is plenty of room for a mild amount of gear. my smaller laptops will fit just fine with room to spare, and on trips where I need only a machine to backup photos, this is what I will use.

I carry the camera with attached 18-55mm lens, 430EX flash, 28-105mm lens, extra batteries and few other odds and ends in the camera portion. The laptop section accommodates my 17"" MacBook Pro, but I doubt would hold most 17"" laptops as mine is a tight fit. There's still plenty of room for full-size headphones, chargers, paperwork, etc. I could slim down my extras and carry an overnight change of clothes and necessities if need be. This pack is also quite comfortable when I ride my cycle to work, wish it was waterproof though(5 Stars, then). It got wet one day, not real soaked, but enough moisture to screw with my phone."

With camera and lenses underneath and laptop in the sleeve, you can get a small notebook, a sunglass case, ipod, a paperback book, and a light jacket and maybe a hat. Of course it has all these nifty compartments for flash cards, a couple of pens, lens cloth, and some business cards. And those are really nice. One big downside is the lack of exterior pockets. THere's a small one at the top back where i kept my ipod. But it could use something to toss in a wallet or glasses at the airport security. As is, you can just jam em in the main compartment with everything else. The computer section fit my 15"" Powerbook nicely. I even got a magazine in there with it. Warning on the camera section. I could barely fit my Canon 30D w/17-85 lens. In fact, the suspension for the camera didn't go up high enough to lift the lens off the bottom of the bag, so I felt a need to place a piece of dense foam on the bottom as extra protection. It worked. But it is the longest lens i'd recommend trying to fit in while mounted. All in all a nice bag for a"

On a recent trip to Europe I put in this bag: 12"" laptop in softsided case, 2 magazines (fit in pocket alongside laptop), mp3 player, sony f828 camera, 2 add on lenses, flash, makeup bag, wallet, pens, europe guidebook, jacket and bottle of water.  Needless to say it was so heavy I almost tipped over, but it certainly held everything I needed.  It was my only carry on.  The cons are as following...  I wish they would put a net/sidepocket for water on the outside, no strap to fasten in the front to take the weight off your shoulders (much needed), outside pocket only fits mp3 player (good if that is what you want it for), no easy access for wallet and cell phone, the other problem I had was that the laptop compartment has 2 zippers which I like, but the main compartment only has one.  It's annoying that one has 2 zippers and the other only has one. Overall it is a very practical bag when you need to bring everything with you!"

My Nikon D300, two lenses, my Mac, and my Kindle were all stowed in my backpack in the rear section of my Prius. Looking at the back of the car, I was convinced that they were all toast. When I could finally extricate them, everything in that well-padded backpack came out just fine. With the 18-200mm lens on the camera, it fits in sideways and the wide-angle has room next to them. The sections are adjustable. There's plenty of room for my Mac Book Pro, the Kindle, chargers, and the contents of my purse. (Since I had to fly home, even my purse fit in the backpack!)"
526743,A1VZH3LLAS192P,0,1,63,B000EY1LCI,1/14/2008,5,3,3,Just what I was looking for!,"I love this bag! I wanted a bag to do it all and this fits the bill to a ""T"". The bag itself is very light weight (a bonus when toting a camera, laptop, wallet and other gear) but seems durable. Another plus, the bag is not huge. I looked at other camera and laptop backpacks and they were just too big for me at 5' tall. A minor quibble is that you can't suspend the camera lens down, it has to be placed with the bottom of the camera along the bottom of the bag. Nevertheless I was able to re-arrange the compartments to hold my Nikon DSLR with a lens attached, another short lens, my flash unit and a Quantum battery pack. My 15"" laptop fits fine with room to put the cords and ""brick"" in the laptop section, my son's 17"" laptop is a tight but doable fit. If I go up to a 17"" laptop the cords would need to go in the gear compartment. The gear compartment has room for a small purse, PDA, paperback size book and size small hoodie. You'd probably have to loose the book if you wore a bigger size. The iPod compartment with pass-through slot for earbuds is an added bonus. After using this bag for a month I liked it so much that I ordered another one for a gift!"

The quality is first rate and all of the compartments are easily accesable. Best for smaller SLRs with out a extra grip.  My Nikon D80 with an 18-200 VR lens just barely fits but I can still carry two other lenses, a flash, and the extra grip off the camera. It does not look like a camera bag and allows me to always have my camera near by.  Great bag for daily use but to small if you are looking for a travel bag and you have a larger Camera kit. For the price it is an increadable bargan!"
526741,A1QHIPH80SDAKN,0,0,61,B000EY1LCI,11/29/2007,4,3,3,Great for what it is,"I have had this bag for a year now and I still use it regularly. I can take my laptop with me to school and still have my camera with a couple of smaller lenses with me in case I happen across something I want to shoot. If you are using this bag as a general use bag and you want a laptop and some food or a change of clothes it is nice. If you have bigger lenses you will run out of space really quickly. The nicest feature of who low profile it is, a few times I have pulled my camera out and friends I was with were amazed that I always have my camera, they thought my bag was a regular backpack. I have taken this bag hiking a couple of times and it was comfortable all day (although if I would have put a laptop in the bag it would have been too heavy.) After a year of at least weekly use the bag is in excellent shape."
526740,A2NBRAF2USUPID,0,1,60,B000EY1LCI,9/14/2007,4,3,3,"Great, lightweight bag.","This bag easily fits my 15"" MacBook Pro, power adapter and notebook lock in the back area. In the bottom camera area, I have my my Canon Rebel XT with 28-90 lens attached, plus a 18-55 lens, 70-300 lens, a film body, and I could probably fit another small lens or perhaps a flash. The middle area fits all of my camera accessories, small notebook accessories and still has room for whatever else I need to take with me. I can fit two textbooks and still have room to spare. I'm 5'7"", and the bag fits very comfortably. It's actually lighter than my old bag that just had my notebook. Although the camera area is on the bottom, I'm able to take out my camera without taking the bag off. I get a little nervous if I try to take lenses out as well, though. My only concern about this bag is that once I upgrade to a bigger camera body it may not fit as well. I still think it will fit with my 18-55 lens, but that's not my general purpose lens, so I'll have to change lenses often. Also, although I can fit my film body in my bag, I don't know if it is big enough for two digital bodies. I guess I'll have to wait and see. UPDATE: I recently purchased the Canon 40D. I now have the 40D with 50mm lens attached, the XT body, a 70-300 lens, 18-55 lens and 28-135 lens. It's a very snug fit and I have to keep my 70-300 lens hood and my flash in the upper compartment. But I feel confident that I can fit my gear when I go on trips, which is the main reason for the camera/laptop bag. It is difficult working out of the bag with one body, though, so now that I have two I will probably have to get a gig bag."
526739,A23JVKOM681A8W,0,1,59,B000EY1LCI,8/3/2007,5,3,3,Bag of my dreams,"I just received this bag and it is exactly what I was looking for.  It easily holds my laptop with room to spare, plus my EOS 20D, a couple of lenses, flash, assorted chargers, etc.  It will even fit a change of clothes or two (admittedly, I'm small).  Even though I am short, it falls perfectly on my back and it doesn't look like a big honkin' backpack you would take camping.  It's quite stylish, too."
526738,A3DI391K4GAI7Q,0,1,58,B000EY1LCI,1/30/2009,5,2,2,Best Backpack I've Ever Owned - Nearly Perfect.,"This bag has absolutely superior build quality.  I use it for travel and for daily treks to work and it looks as new as the day I bought it almost two years ago, even with near daily abuse in all kinds of weather conditions. For being relatively compact, it holds a lot of gear in very smartly arranged pockets and compartments.  The compact factor is a huge plus as it will actually fit under the seat in front of you on most commercial aircraft!  Tons of pockets and compartments so everything has it's own place and keeps everything nice and organized.  Even with all your camera gear packed up, it is still big enough to swallow a 17"" notebook computer. Just be sure to remove the extra padded insert at the bottom of the note book area to ensure proper fit of larger laptops. My only MAJOR gripe about this back pack is that the front pocket only has ONE zipper, so you have to open it from the side and risk things falling out.  Would have been better with two pulls so you could open just the top to retrieve items without opening the entire compartment.  In a bag this well designed, I simply can't believe that was overlooked. And one final note... do not expect to be able to tote your big DSLR with a big lens attached in the bottom compartment.  There is, however, plenty of space for a DSLR with a smaller walkabout lens attached and two additional larger lenses.  I use a Canon 30D and have no problems fitting all the gear I need.  3 Lenses (1 smaller one attached to the camera and two extras on the sides), charger, extra battery, extra memory cards, card reader and cables.  Leave one extra lens at home and you've got room for a nice big external flash. Lastly, the most impressive thing about this bag is that it looks like a fairly standard back pack.  It doesn't look big enough to hold DSLR camera gear, nor is it apparent that it might be hiding your 17"" MacBook Pro. Given it's size, it doesn't draw any attention to itself or the thousands of dollars of gear you're probably toting with you. All in all, no other bag on the market is built as well as this one if you need to haul both camera and computer gear with you on a regular basis. Highly recommended."
526737,AEFZBC4Y90QIV,0,0,57,B000EY1LCI,2/27/2008,3,2,2,Not so great bag though,"I am somewhat disappointed with this bag.  The computer compartment is ok.  But the bottom camera compartment is too small for a decent DSLR and any accessories.  It is difficult to reach and get the camera in and out.  You have to put the bag down, open the zip completely and get the camera out. You need to be careful how to position the camera in the bag also since the padding is kind of weak at the bottom too.  The top compartment can only fit some clothing or books since it has no padding at all.  Maybe it is ok for some day trip in the cities."
526736,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0,0,56,B000EY1LCI,1/20/2008,4,2,2,Suitable for casual use . . .,"This backpack has three main compartments.  One, 12 inch wide by 15 inch high, is designed to carry a laptop.  A padded (reconfigurable) six section compartment at the bottom, is designed to accommodate SLR bodies, shorter lenses and other accessories.  Above the SLR compartment is a compartment for miscellaneous items. The laptop compartment is compact.  There is space for the computer, a few accessories, and not too much else.  There is a decent amount of padding all around, with more at the bottom.  It is a snug fit for a full-sized laptop, and assuming no drops or radical impacts, it should be secure and reasonably well protected. The SLR compartment can hold quite a bit.  Fully loaded, two SLR bodies and two or three shorter lens.  A SLR body with a battery grip attached can be accommodated.  Flash units or lenses up to 5.5"" will probably fit.  The dividers can be custom configured to suit your gear, so a body with a lens attached, can be accommodated, though depending on the length of your lens, you will probably sacrifice a lot of space in order to do this.  If you do not have a lot of gear, this is not an issue.  If you have more gear, you may have to carry them disassembled.  If you carry a camera with the lens attached, it may take a bit of practice to be able to get the pack off, and then get the camera out safely and smoothly. The compartment for miscellaneous gear is above the SLR compartment, so anything in there will rest on your camera gear.  The padding in between the two sections is probably substantial enough to prevent physical damage from light cargo, but you be the judge whether you risk putting liquids or heavier items in there.  There is just canvas material, no padding, on the top of the pack.  The upper compartment seems designed for lightweight items, and it has two small zippered pockets, four penholder sleeves, and a larger open pocket.  A set of double pull zippers, to match the other compartments, would have been more convenient. There is also a small zippered compartment on the top for a MP3 player or a small radio.  Two pockets are located at the back corners at the base of the pack.  These have no zippers or fasteners, and are too shallow to be of much practical use.  Whatever you stick in there could put pressure on your camera gear.  Not a good design. Ample padding on the back of the pack helps to `float' it off your back.  The design of shoulder straps is incorporated with the carrying handle, and the comfort of the fit may depend on your body type.  The straps are set at a fixed distance from each other, and you may not feel very comfortable if you have broad shoulders or a large neck.  The straps could do with a bit more padding, and having a waist belt might have been a good idea.  Considering the weight of a fully load pack, and the potential value of the contents, going with a separate more secure rubber handle rather than the integral cloth one might have been better. You might want to think twice about putting a SLR with a lens attached, lens down in the middle of the SLR compartment as shown in one of the manufacturer's illustrations.  Particularly if the lens is a longer one, and you have heavy items in the top compartment. This compact pack meets the size limitations for air travel, and is a good option for light travel, or if you don't have a large amount of camera gear.  It is well-built, but not designed for heavy duty use or hiking.  You would be well advised to try it before you buy it.  If you want one, the price has dropped, so shop around and you might find yourself a deal."
526735,A2LGQTXOFFOU9T,0,1,55,B000EY1LCI,8/23/2007,4,2,2,Wonderful in China,"I purchased this bag to bring my camera on a week-long trip to China.  I was surprised by how much it held!  I fit my Olympus E-500, a 14mm-45mm lens, a 45-150 lens, a 30mm macro, a home-made diffuser, two guidebooks, snacks, and 3.5 liters of water.  I took it all around Beijing and on about 10km of the Great Wall.  The bag did get pretty heavy after a long day, but remained relatively comfortable despite the weight (and heat in Beijing!).  The biggest downside is that this bag is not weather resistant, but fortunately I didn't get rained on at all! If you're looking for a bag that will hold a lot of stuff, don't want to spend a lot of money, don't need quick access to your camera, and don't need weatherproofing, this bag is great!"
526734,AQP6IS55XUWH4,0,0,54,B000EY1LCI,7/24/2007,4,2,2,excellent camera/computer back pack for the tourist,"I bought this bag recently for a trip with my Pentax K100D + Tamron 18-250mm lens. I could fit these comfortably along with my 14.5 widescreen laptop. I had space in the laptop section for my monopod too! The bag was comfortable to carry . The partitions in the camera section have enough space to hold additional small focal length lenses. The section above the camera partitions can be used to hold small items / water/food/ reading material etc. There are separate pouches for spare batteries/memory cards etc. The only -ve was the single zipper for the front section - a minor issue. The  bag is not supposed to be weather proof... but this was not important for me. Suits my needs perfectly and is a compact day pack. However, if you only intend to carry your camera +one lens, you may want to look at smaller camera only bags. Highly recommended."
526733,A4165GW5PFL06,0,0,53,B000EY1LCI,7/11/2007,4,2,2,overall great pack,"I needed something to carry both digital camera (Canon S3 is), Gorillapod, battery charger and a couple of converter lens, as well as a large HP widescreen 17"" laptop (15.5"" x 1.75"" x 10.75"") with chargers, etc. plus a notebook and other supplies. Miracle is it all actually does fit in this pack. However, for the laptop I did remove the added padding strip attached to the bottom of the pack as with this padding in place the fit was so very tight that I was concerned the zippers might not hold up. With the padding strip removed (there is adequate padding without this added strip) the laptop still fits snugly but easily zips without undo stress. If you have a laptop larger than mine you might consider another solution as I don't see how this pack could possible hold the 12.2 x 1.8 x 15.9 as specified. It would be nice if the upper compartment had two zippers like the computer and camera sections instead on the one. This pack is light weight compared to my laptop briefcase and is much easier to handle plus it accommodates the camera stuff. Quality product that I would rate a five except that the spec for the computer seems exagerated to me and the lack of the two zippers for the upper compartment."

I have a with a and a couple smaller lenses, and I also have a . This case is PERFECT! It looks like it would also fit the larger 17"" laptop, but the 15"" feels very safe and protected in there. The Canon just fits with the relatively large 17-85mm lens (but the camera would not fit if a larger lens was attached). The top compartment is roomy enough for all my normal airplane carryon stuff. This bag is very solid, it stands upright when set on the ground, and the design is extremely high quality.  Even the cut of the shoulder strap is great, as it lessens slipping when you are only carrying it on one shoulder. I expected this to be just a cheap ""for now"" bag to use until I found one I loved. But this is the one!"

It will hold my 17""PowerBook, too, but that's not what I'm using today.  In the computer section I also have a magazine, a book (Apartment Therapy), and the power adaptor.  In the tiny pocket in front I have my cell phone. In the main compartment I have a bag with 4 prescription bottles, a full size hairbrush. A cd holder for 50 cd and a cd player (it's about the size of a canteen), my gorilla pod, a wallet, some misc. toiletries that I purchased on the way to the caf?, my journal, a pen, some earphones.

I packed all my camera gear in the bottom compartments and had plenty of room for my laptop and other stuff. The bag fits real well on my back and is light weight. Things I wished the bag had was a place for my cell phone and reading glasses. Otherwise overall a very good bag.

My Canon 40D with battery grip fits in the camera section OK.  I can only fit it with my f/1.8 50mm lens attached, not my 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6.  I have to take off the 28-135mm and place it next to the camera in the bottom.  I regularly carry a lot of electronics in this (Nokia N800, Palm Treo, Panasonic Point and shoot, iPod, Shure headphones, lens cleaning kit and pen, + all the chargers and extra batteries/ It does get a little heavy with all of that in there) and I still have plenty of room for all my school stuff. One issue I take with it is how the flat bottom looks kind of goofy when you wear it."

We were able to fit a Canon Rebel XTI, 85mm prime lens with hood, 17-50mm zoom lens with hood, 18-55 kit lens, and my husband's laptop and all of our accessories.  It was a bit heavy, but well worth not having to carry multiple bags around on our trip.  We also have a diaper bag we have to carry, so 3 bags would have been a bit much.  Great purchase for $50."

Everything fits perfectly, even the laptop! There has been some chatter on the reviews on this, that 17"" laptops dont fit. This is true if you don't remove the foam insert from the bottom of the laptop compartment. I was struggling to get my lappy to fit until I realized it was there; once removed, everything fit easily. My only gripes about this bag are the single zipper on the main compartment, and a lack of places on the bag to attach carabiners to. Other than that, it's perfect."

The pockets are well-constructed and designed to allow storage of the computer, its associated gear, and a small manual or two. Prior to obtaining this item, I had the standard off-the-shoulder pack which caused wear on my shoulders, necessitating constant switching. This backpack allows a much more convenient carrying style. It is also easier to remove the computer for airline security inspections.

Her main concern was having to carrying a fairly large cam bag, as well as a laptop bag when traveling. The bag proved to be such a great solution to the two bag issue, I ordered it for myself. In my case, this bag solves my 3 bag needs. Not only is there a space for my cam/laptop, there is a generous sized compartment (big enough to carry contents of you pocketbook). If you're a knitter, you'll find that the lens compartments are great storage for notions/yarn. As a knitter, you're always looking for the best way to carry all of your normal crap, AND you're knitting. Well the CompuDayPack is definitely something to consider. My only complaint is that the main compartment only has one zipper. So if you're not holding the bag fully upright, there's a chance that you stuff will come spilling out."

I can even fit my 17-35mm lens too if needed. One item, FYI: there's an extra layer of padding that's Velcro'd in the bottom of the laptop chamber, to use for smaller than 17"" laptops. Just pull that out and your 17"" will fit. Also, mine has dual zippers on every compartment; some reviews said they had only a single zipper pull. Not sure what's going on there... One other nice feature is the fact that it stands upright on its own (huge help when getting the laptop in and out quickly at Security in airports), and it has a great, well-placed padded handle at the top. This means I can carry it like a briefcase if needed. On the front is a lined iPod pocket with headphone cable port, which for me actually works as a great place to store ID when going through the airport. Bottom line: if you have a monster laptop and a DSLR and you travel, this bag is just perfect. And, it's a LowePro, which means it's designed for photographers who have a laptop, not just a laptop bag that maybe fits your camera."

I looked at pretty much all the laptop/camera backpacks I could find, and I settled on this one because of price/features/style (in that order.) I use it as my every-day backpack now, because I like to carry my camera wherever I go. Just to give you an idea of how much room there is, here's what I carry in it on a regular basis: ~ Canon digital Rebel XT, with kit lens and battery grip attached ~ Tamron 28-300 lens ~ 550EX flash ~ AA battery charger & batteries All of that fits perfectly in the bottom camera compartment. In the rest of the backpack I carry: ~ Motion Computing LE1600 tablet PC with an extra battery, and an external CDR/DVD drive (this all fits in the laptop compartment.) ~ Canon SD630 (my compact poin-and-shoot camera, which fits in the external zippered pocket.) ~ Memory card wallet, card reader, extra camera batteries, writing pad, pens, various cables, lens caps, headphones, cleaning cloths, mini tripod, camera remote, 3 enclosed laptop hardrives - all of which fit in the main compartment. Even with all of that gear, I can still manage to cram a small lunch into the backpack on days when I ride my motorcycle to work! The straps are well padded, and have the loops that allow you to attach other Lowepro accessory pouches. Getting into all of the compartments is fairly easy - you can get your camera out quick, but I recommend setting the backpack down before you do. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish there were a couple more outside zippered pouches, and an all black version instead of the two-tones. This backpack is not huge, but if you learn how to ""pack smart"" you'll get more use out of it than you would expect!"

526674,A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V,0,1,57,B000EZY19W,1/21/2007,3,303,305,"It's doing the job, but...","I bought this scanner a month ago to scan the several thousand slides I have taken over the past years. I'm not a professional photographer - my expectations were only to digitize my slides to the same quality as the photos I have been taking with my 7mp digital camera.  After receiving the scanner (which set up easily) I did an extensive set of tests to determine the appropriate settings (resolution, compression, etc), and then set about scanning my slides. Now that I am 2/3 done with the task I can say that it's working OK, but there are goods and bads.  I have no experience with other film scanners so I can't say how this unit compares to others, but here's what I have learned: * Many have complained about the flimsiness of the plastic slide holder.  Mine has held up fine so far, but I can find no information anywhere about how I would get a replacement if I broke the one that came with the scanner, which concerns me a little. * Epson's web site is not very helpful.  They have a simple FAQ with some basic items, but nothing really helpful, and no discussion groups.  You are on your own. * As others have commented, the included software is pretty basic, but I think it gets the job done.  It has at least 2 very annoying flaws, though.  One is that every time I preview scan another set of 12 slides, it turns off the dust removal and/or digital ICE selection.  This means that you need to remember to turn it back on with every scan, which I have forgotten to do some times.  There appears to be a way of saving your settings, but even that gets reset on every scan, so is useless.  Maybe there is a way to make this work right, but the sparse documentation yields no clues. * Another software issue is its ability to recognize the vertical or horizontal orientation of slides.  Mostly it does a really good job with this, but sometimes it guesses wrong, e.g. it will think a slide is vertical when it actually is horizontal. Usually this happens if the slide has a dark background.  Unfortunately when it guesses wrong, it crops off the sides or the top/bottom of the picture, so you can't just rotate it 90 degrees.  Most of the time when I notice a wrong guess I have been able to correct it by rotating the slide 90 degrees and re-previewing, but I have several slides where it simply insists on getting it wrong and the software provides no way to override this behavior.  A related bad behavior occurs if you have a slide that has a bright rectangle on a dark background, e.g. a shot of TV screen - in that case, it tries to zoom in on part of the picture, cropping off much of it including even some of the light area.  I can find no way to defeat this behavior, so apparently the only remedy is to crop this type of image manually, which is going to be very labor intensive. * Another problem relates to a hardware design flaw that I am very surprised that no one has mentioned.  After scanning my first several batches of slides and examining the results carefully, I went into a mode of scanning without taking the time to examine every resulting image.  After scanning a LOT of slides, I started reviewing the results and was horrified to notice that on certain batches, there were 2 faint vertical lines (one green, one blue) down certain scans.  I finally noticed that the lines seemed to be on 4 consecutive slides out of every 12 (the slide holder contains 12 slides), so that was a clue.  Notice that the top of the scanner has a transparent slit down the middle - apparently this is a sexy feature so you can see where the scanner light is and watch its motion.  Well, it also admits other light into the scanner, at least under certain ambient light conditions, ruining the scans of the 4 slides in the middle column.  I fixed this by taping a piece of cardboard to the top of the scanner.  And now I have to re-scan a lot of messed-up images. * I really can't notice that the Digital ICE feature does anything except quadruple the amount of time it takes to scan each set of slides.  I tried doing scans with it and without it, and can notice little difference.  Not much of a problem, since I the Epson software de-selects the option to use it after each preview scan as mentioned above. * I suppose it's not really a fault of the scanner, but watch out for dust!  It's really important to blow off your slides before every scan, and also the scanner glass.  Despite being really careful, I still have a big issue with dust.  Would have been nice if Epson had included a brush and something to blow with (I got a squeeze bulb blower that helps a lot).  When I am done with my scanning project I'm considering replacing the electronic air cleaner in my home with this unit, since it seems to be a dust magnet!  :-) * One last comment.  This is not a general-purpose scanner, i.e. you really wouldn't want to use it as a document scanner, mainly because every time you want to use it, it needs to warm up for a minute.  Fortunately I have another scanner for documents, and it works instantaneously. It's possible that some of the items above are user error on my part, but with the meager documentation and web site, it's hard to develop a detailed understanding of the unit without a lot of experimentation, which might cause one to miss something.  Your mileage might vary."
526671,A15G70V9OBTOVO,0,0,54,B000EZY19W,7/26/2006,4,93,100,Great for flat art and large film.,"I bought a V700 because my Epson 4990 developed a bad pixel and the V750 was not yet available.  This my fourth Epson scanner and its really much the same as the others.  Its fine for scanning photos or documents, surprisingly good for medium format or large format film and lousy for 35mm.  When you consider that a really good, flat field process lens for duplicating 35mm slides costs almost as much as this scanner you realize you get what you pay for. If you're not especially quality conscious and have a lot of slides to scan, this is the way to go.  And I would argue that a lot of people who've switched to digital and think a 6 or 8 megapixel camera captures the same amount of detail as a Velvia 35mm transparency are not very quality conscious.  And hey, that's fine.  After all, in the digital world, convenience trumps everything else unless you are willing to spend really big money. I find the supplied Epson Scan software does a fine job.  There's also a lite version of SilverFast which can squeeze out a bit more quality but it has a ""steep learning curve"" which is marketing department talk for difficult/complex/time consuming. One minor, obscure detail.  At the top of the scanner bed there are two, raised ""bumps"".  I'm not sure what they're for but they make it impossible to scan a section of anything larger than 9 x 12.  So, for example if you have something that's 11 x14 and you want to scan a section of it for eBay, you can't on the V700.  Or course its not intended for this but I thought it worth mentioning. All in all, I'm pleased.  The film holders are terrific.  I make really good, sharp scans from 6x7 and 4x5 film and of course it does a great job with paper.  But if you need to scan 35mm in high enough quality to make enlargements (meaning 8x10 prints, not wallet photos or something for the web) you'll need a Coolscan or better yet, an Imacon."

I considered a dedicated film scanner, but didn't want to pay for one that could scan negatives up to 4x5. Long story short, I bought the V700 and it has far exceeded my expectations. It will scan a whole sheet of negatives to make great proof sheets. With the slide holder it'll scan 12 slides, but I've found I can skip the holder and lay 20 slides on the glass to just make a proof sheet. I don't use the enhancement software so scans are very fast. My favorite thing about the scanner is that it's a time machine. My family and I are enjoying slides and negs I hadn't looked at in thirty years. There are some esoteric reasons this scanner isn't quite as good as a dedicated film scanner, but I'll bet 99.999% of the population would never be able to tell the difference."

My requirements are to be able to scan everything from 35mm slides and negatives to 4X5 transparencies and negatives.  This replaces an older Epson flatbed/film scanner that I thought was doing a good job, until I scanned the same negative on the V700.  Holding the resolution constant between the two, and scaning the same 4X5 BW negative, the scans seem sharper with better contrast.  Controlling a scan is easy with the provided software.  I have scans from a dedicated 35mm film scanner and find that scans from the V700 range from nearly as good to better than the dedicated scanner results (all run at 3200 dpi).

I end up scanning at 1200 DPI anyway. The main problem is that the multi-strip frames (35mm or 120)absolutely do not work so I always scan using the film area guide and no individual templates like I had on my 1640 are provided to assist this. It does scan faster and it did permit me to fully scan all of my 6x17 negatives and slides which I could not scan on the 1640...so at least I got something for my money. Oh yes, it does come with Lasersoft and has a reasonably good version of its own, but if you are using CS3 for everything, what's the point? Once you get the negatives positioned correctly and reasonably flat (a bit tricky with 120 film), the film scans are beautiful, exceeding what I can get with my digital SLR."

You get a out of date version of Photoshop Elements and the SilverFast SE didn't work at all on my Mac until I downloaded an update. I know SilverFast always seems to get great reviews but I have never been impressed with it and it is a pain to use. Everytime you update it you have to go through the whole process of digging up the serial number and typing it in at the website and even then they don't have profiles of the latest color films.

I have also used the negative holder with similar good results.

Installation was shockingly simple, as simple as much lower-end scanners. I love it when a new device integrates with no issues. I set up the scanner, ran the install software, turned it on and got the drivers from the disk. It was immediately available from Photoshop. So I grabbed a picture off the desk and scanned it. It came through, with nothing but default settings, at a higher quality than I expected. The V700 is demonstrating it's worth right out of the box. When scanning, you can take control of the method and image. It has a full-auto mode, which I used on that first scan, a home mode, which gives you some control, and a professional mode, which gives you a pretty high-end set of controls over the scanning method, image types, image quality, etc. It's all intuitive and easy to use, which is good since there is no printed manual. There is an online guide though. Reading through the guide, the instructions are clear and concise, so doing something like setting up negatives for scanning is easy. You can start scans from the V700 as well as from software. My wife, the graphic artist in the house (I'm tech support), prefers to pull the scans from Adobe Photoshop, which worked like a charm. The scanner comes with templates for use with film. There are several for most standard sizes of negative. There is also a slide template. They're a bit difficult to orient correctly at first, but the documentation cleared up any issues. Setting really high quality scans did result in longer scan times (MUCH longr), but the output was simply amazing. I was able to scan negatives (and it's not something I've had good luck doing in the past). Actually, scanning the negatives was fun. You have to get the right side up though. Again, image quality coming out of the scanner was pretty stunning. Overall, this was an outstanding experience. The V700 is so easy to set up and use, it's kind of hard to believe it's nearly a professional level machine."

You might be a professional photographer wanting to scan your older work.  You might be an amateur wanting to scan many old family photos.  Either way, you might find something you want in this product. I, for one, am an amateur photographer but I also have been working to scan in thousands of old family photos and negatives.  I have previously spent hundreds of dollars getting the scans done professionally and if you do not have the time to scan the photos yourself that is an option.  However, if you have the time and patience you can look at this scanner to do the work.  But beware, you will need to learn how to use it because it's not just ""push a button and watch it do the magic.""  This is a professional piece of equipment. First, this scanner does an excellent job of producing quality images.  For the price, you are getting very good quality.  It is certainly above the typical scanner, as it should be.  There is very little that compromises the quality of this scanner's product. This scanner allows you to scan multiple slides at once (many more than other scans normally would).  That's a great feature, but the ability to batch scan combined with the dual lens system and other features makes this scanner a hefty piece of equipment.  The preview image on the product's page looks big, but you have no idea until you actually receive this item. I have heard some complaints about the plastic film holder and other plastic pieces.  While I would prefer to have a more sturdy construction in areas, I do not mark that as a complaint.  The scanner is well-built and I feel comfortable that I will own it for a long time without many problems.  However, the downside to a lightweight, plastic film holder is that if you aren't very careful your images might not scan properly (and might not be up to the quality they should) due to their placement against the glass (or not). The software is somewhat easy to use but you will have to walk through many features to understand it all.  Installation was a breeze and it's worth giving their software a try.  But you can always use the scanner with other imaging software as well. Overall, I'd recommend this scanner to most people, especially a professional or to those wanting to scan a large quantity of photographs.  Just be prepared to work for good scans."
526653,A680RUE1FDO8B,0,0,36,B000EZY19W,10/23/2008,5,5,5,A masterful technical achievement - how far we've come.,"Not all that many years ago, I had one of the first slide scanners available. It boasted an ability to convert slides to an amazing 640 x 480 pixels. Now the Epson Perfection V700 is capable of 6400dpi resolution and in constant dollars costs less than half of what I paid for that now primitive and long obsolete transparency scanner. And the V700 does so much more than that old unit. First, the unit itself. It is big. The V700 is not something you're going to leave sitting on the kitchen table, unless you eat out all the time. The cover, with its built-in lighting for film scanning, is about two inches thick. One very cute and clever feature is a slot running down the center of the cover. A blue diode scampers down as a scan is progressing, a really nice way to find out where you're at in the scanning process. The V700 is a specialized unit, intended for photo print and film scanning. There is no ADF (Automatic Document Feeder)accessory available. And, frankly, considering the heftiness of the top cover, you're not going to want to do a lot of casual document scanning. Setup was quick and problem free on a computer running Windows Vista Ultimate. There are the Epson utilities to load, including Epson Scan software, a hobbled version of Silverfast, which is dedicated scanning software and Adobe PhotoShop Elements (Version 5 for Windows, including Vista and Version 4 for the Mac). I started my tests with photo prints. The V700, whether using Epson Scan or SilverFast is quick. Probably, in fact, one of the fastest scanners I've ever seen. Response was so quick thst it surprised me. I just picked a print off a display on a credenza. I am pleased to report that the V700 not only captured every detail in the print, but every speck of dust on the print as well. That is praise, by the way. I used the digital ICE feature to reduce the dust and it performed moderately well with no measurable increase in scanning time. The ScanFast software has a  bit of a learning curve and the user interface harks back to Windows 3.x. Tooltips are uninformative and the program is not at all intuitive. I just used the default settings and the results were fine. I know, however, that ScanFast can do a lot more. I just have to get into the not-terribly-well-written-or-translated documentation. Holders are supplied for 35mm mounted slides and film strips, 2-1/4 and 4x5 film. The holders don't appear to be all that sturdy, but Epson doesn't mention how to get additional holders. One of these days - and soon - I will contact their support department. I used only the 35mm slide carrier. It holds 12 at a time. Inserting slides is simple and fast, though you do have to take care to make sure the slides are fully and properly inserted. It is easy to leave a slide not fully inserted in the holder and thus not parallel to the scanning surface which could create problems. The Epson Scan software previews all 12 slides in the holder. You can then select the slides you want to actually scan. The Epson scan software automatically splits the multiple slides into individual images. Scans of slides are terrific without any adjustment. I chose a bunch, with exposures ranging from good to awful. Reproduction was faithful. Epson Scan has a limited, but adequate toolset, for correction and enhancement. SilverFast has a much more sophisticated toolset, but you'll have to read the manual to use it. I ran tests with Epson Scan up to 1200dpi. Results were, in a word, outstanding. I think it is amazing that the technology has come so far, so fast. Back in the day, when resolution capability this high became available, it cost several times what the V700 does. For a very reasonable price, the V700 provides a high level of scanning capability. My estimate is that, without special adjustments, you could convert a couple of hundred slides an hour to digital format. Good stuff indeed. Jerry"

Four plastic slide holders are included, two for film strips, one for medium format and 4 x 5 negatives and one for slides (12 slide capacity).  They do the job, but as has been noted elsewhere, they are flimsy.  A slide-in white-backed panel allows print and document scanning. Set-up was straightforward on my Windows XP computer with minimal directions provided in a large fold-out illustrated sheet. Included is a two-part power plug, USB cable, three software discs and a Silverfast manual.  An online User's Guide is included. Installation was straight-forward and took about five minutes.  Make sure you follow directions and install the software before plugging in the USB cable. My first test scans were accomplished easily (this scanner is fast!) and with excellent results. As noted by another reviewer, I found the Silverfast software cumbersome and chose to use the Epson scanning software.  Photoshop Elements 5 is included in this bundle, and I made adjustments with this program but find I am used to my Photoshop so will use that instead.  Photos scanned to 48 bits on this 6400dpi are considerably faster and cleaner than with my Epson 1650.  I am impressed. I have yet to begin scanning my considerable slide stash, but  based on the reports of other, I am certain the results for my older slides will be equally spectacular, especially when using the included Digital Ice feature for scratch and dust removal."

I didn't want to send the slides off to be done for fear of them getting lost. I didn't want to purchase a drum slide scanner just for that purpose and would not get used anymore. Someone pointed me to the Epson V700 flat bed scanner. I could not be more pleased with the reproduction of my slides which were in varying condition. Some were taken in the early 50's with an old Argus C3, 35mm up to the 80's with the film 35mm SLR Cameras of the time. I am an ""old timer"" with some experience in amateur photography and as far as I am concerned the V700 has done an amazing job in restoring my slides, some to better than origional condition. The Epson software worked great for what I needed. It had a professional mode, but I used the Home mode, which gave me some editing to get the resuls I needed. The reproduction of the color was great in many of the slides and overall reproduction on all the slides was better than I had hoped for. I recommend going to www.Photo-i.co.uk/Reviews/interactive/Epson%20v700/page_1.htm for a complete review of the V700. It really helped me in making my choice."

The scanner just slices off the film strip at a fixed interval that doesn't happen to jibe with my photos.  I checked everything, reloaded all the software, followed instructions to the letter, and finally called Epson product support. I was on the phone on ""my dime"" for 20 minutes.  All they could suggest was to use the full strip mode and crop the images on the film strip.  That is unacceptable because it's a real loss in productivity.  They said it might be that my photos were dark or there was a dark area in the photo.  My photos were not dark in general but you can find a dark area in ANY photo. A further disappointment was the graininess of all the scanned photos even when scanning at 2400 and 4800 dpi.  I would have to edit all the photos to remove noise and graininess. I tried the Digital ICE and was further disappointed first because the scanner stops and has to ""warm up"" again in the middle of processing each photo.  Further, the Digital ICE photos were very grainy as well. I bought this scanner to replace my Nikon CoolScan because that unit takes forever to scan slides and 35mm film stips.

At 4800dpi,(6400 seems like overkill and photo-i's reviews indicate 4800 seems to be optimal) from a 35mm transparency you get approximately a 50mb file! Unless your printing murals, this is probably overkill too.  To get that kind of file and resolution from a digital slr, be ready to get into the 20-24megapixal and 7 to $8000 dollar range for a camera. Of course, this is speaking from a position of strictly dollar for dollar resolution and file size. AI's software is adequate to get a image into photoshop.  stay away from any manipulation in scanning software unless no other choice.  Not at all impressed w/ Digital Ice.

First, it provides at least as good performance as purpose-built film scanners at a significantly lower cost and far greater flexibility- and just try to find a film scanner for medium or large format. It is capable of ridiculously high resolution; I tried scanning an ASA 160 6x4.5 negative at 6400 DPI, and found I was getting about four pixels for each grain. The very nice set of film holders that come with it don't hold the film ultra-flat, but the scanner has enough depth of field to deal with reasonable film curvature. Scanning at very high resolution is an exercise in patience- it takes a LONG time- but these are 100 Mb+ files, so it is to be expected. What would I like to add? Only a very few things. How about a rotatable scan frame? You can size it but not rotate it, so you need to place your original dead square. Also, while it seems to compensate for the orange negative mask well, different film companies' masks are slightly different, and it would be nice to be able to select the film type.

The free Silverfast scanning app work fine until it crashed during a cancelled scan. For unknown reason after the crash, it won't accept registration again. Which is fine...I can live with out it. I gave this scanner a four star because this kind of quality used to cost over $1000 in semi-pro range for professional usage. Granted it's no drum scan, but that would be a total overkill."

It came with a 35mm slide holder, 4x5 negative holder, 35mm negative holder, and 2 film guides. It also came with an additional scanning software disc (silverfast) and a copy of photoshop elements. I found this to be a great deal for the price I paid. Overall I recommend this flat bed for anyone who wants to get good resolution scans of their photographs, negatives, and even documents. The only better jump would be to purchase a imacon hasselblad scanner and I personally do not have the $13,000 to do that.

I swore I'd never buy another after my first experience with Epson software, even though the scanner (under $100) did a beautiful job with 35mm slides. After reading a lot of reviews on the V700 I changed my mind and purchased the unit a week ago. Epson may know how to design scanners but they do not know how to write software to support them. I have had problems saving custom scan settings for 6x6 negatives; it wants to reset to normal scan settings. I finally found that I have to deselect ""thumbnail view."" Unfortunately, thumbnail view is the best way to preview and crop. Custom settings are automatically named setting 1, etc. and you can not rename them to something recognizable. The manual is worthless. If you do a search on a menu term it tells you the term is not found. The Epson website is not helpful either. I've called support twice and both times had an extremely poor telephone connection; I had trouble hearing the tech and she had trouble hearing me. I have scanned 35mm negatives, slides and 6x6 medium format B&W negatives and the results are great. If you're an experienced scanner and don't mind the lack of a manual or a decent telephone connection with tech support, then this may be the scanner for you."

I basically use this machine for scanning old photos for restoring and scanning pictures from magazines and various sources for printing as photos.  The setup was very simple and the operation of the scanner could not be easier.  There is an easy scan mode and a professional mode, giving you total control over all attributes of your scan. I cannot think of anything that I would like to control that I am not able to control with the scanner settings.  The quality of the scans is really outstanding.  Even when scanning from less-than-perfect quality sources, the scan ultimately looks great if you tweak some of the scan settings. This is a solid and efective scanner for the uses mentioned above."
526634,AGOH8N902URMW,0,0,17,B000EZY19W,10/21/2008,5,1,1,Really a fine and mature product!  A clear winner!!!!,I own a Epson high-end scanner 2 models back. This model is a clear winner and upgrade as I see it. The software installation is just perfect in my Vista 32 Dell Workstation. Right out of the box -- put a photo on the flatbed - press the one button scan and you will be amazed. The digital-ice as we all know is amazing - a real edge is hardware assisted restoration. All the manual and fine adjustments are available in the professional mode. The build quality is clearly excellent. Good software package with Silverfast. Support is good at this level but it is not their pro-level support. This is a great choice to sum it up! It does as good a job on 35mm film as mu Nikon coolscan 4000. That is a major achievement!

The Silverfast  software that offered so much promise is very poorly documented and I was unable to get it setup or deleted properly from my computer (Mac).  The scanner results using Elements  IV to recover old damaged slides and negatives is terrific.  The ability to scan up to 12 slides at a time is a great convenience.  I have 30,000 slides and while it will take a lot of work the product will allow me to put all the material on CDs very cheaply."

I haven't had much experience yet but had it up and running quickly and am impressed with the scanning of slides using Epson software and default settings.  The really, really bad thing about my experience was Amazon's poor shipping and handling.  I purchased my first V700 a month ago and returned it because both the shipping container and epson box were severely punctured.  The shipping box was much larger than the Epson box and had almost no packing in it.  I thought this was probably not the original box, was probably added somerwhere along the route, and sent it back and ordered another scanner.  It arrived yesterday in the same kind of box, almost no packing, with damage and coming apart at the seams.  I took a chance this time and the scanner seems to work fine.  Amazon used to be a class act.  What happened?  I would never order another expensive electronic item from them until their shipping problem is resolved."
526624,A1NGI5E6RCJKRV,0,0,7,B000EZY19W,5/9/2007,4,3,5,Pretty pleased with this scanner,"I purchased this scanner so that I could preserve a large find of family photos.  While I don't know everything yet about how to use it, I can tell you that it scans beautifully, and that the film holders really cut down on time.  Before I did them individually and it took forever.  Now I do four strips at a time and edit later. On the negative side, the manual is an absolute joke.  There is no meaningful documentation. So don't count on being able to look stuff up, because you can't.  And secondly, and this is happening a lot lately, the box from Amazon got really roughed up on the way.  I was very disappointed in that.  When I bought another device, a smaller one, the USPS used rubber bands and left it sitting on the open lid of my mailbox.  That's not Amazon's fault, but I've been unhappy with packaging/delivery several times lately and I'd like them to be aware of it. All in all, though, I have a lot to learn, and no manual, but I'm reasonably smart and have figured out what I need to know.  I'm overall quite pleased."
526623,A3HDWS4AV1A6ZC,0,1,6,B000EZY19W,7/19/2008,1,15,25,You've got to be kidding me!,"For 500 dollars the least the manufacturer could do is throw in some film holders that aren't absolute garbage.  I shoot medium format film through a Fuji GA645, a camera justifiably well known for having a razor sharp lens, near perfect exposure, and to-die-for autofocus.  Imagine my surprise when my first negatives scanned soft and out of focus. So I poke around Flickr a bit and discover that film laid flat on the scan bed with the film holder pressing it to the glass gives markedly better results than actually inserting the film in the holder as instructed by Epson.  10 minutes of swearing while trying to accomplish this not so easy feat (go ahead and try for yourself), and 20 minutes of scanning (while still swearing) later, I discover that, lo and behold, the Flickr folks are right. Negatives flat on the glass scan vastly better than negatives in the holder.  In fact, at 4800dpi, negatives flat on the glass so exceed my needs that I turned the resolution down a notch.  I'll go one step further and say that if Epson had included film holders that weren't total GARBAGE, i.e., a double glass plate system designed to hold the negative at EXACTLY THE FOCAL PLANE, I might be giving this system five stars instead of one. I don't know what misbegotten moron over at Epson decided to cheap out, and I don't care.  I'll be searching the web for some sort of film holder that actually, you know, WORKS, (or other solution, maybe I can design and manufacture my own, get rich fixing Epson's grievous failings) since laying it on the glass in perfect alignment without curl or dust is such a monumental pain.  If I can't find a solution shortly, this thing is going to be returned, and good riddance. It'll be a cold day in damnation before I buy another Epson product. EDIT:  Ok, it is possible to get somewhat decent scans out of this heap.  Follow these instructions: First, turn your film holder over and pull out the little feet.  Turn them around 180 degrees so the arrow points toward the plus sign, then put them back in.  For some reason the focal plane is a bit high off the glass, about 3.5mm.  Guess how high the feet are set at the factory?  If you guessed 3.0mm, give yourself a gold star. Way to go, Epson, you big wet bag of smelly FAIL. If that doesn't work, then turn your Adjustment Options completely off and run a test scan.  According to the Photo-i review I read, Digital ICE in Quality mode is garbage, while Digital ICE in Speed mode is actually somewhat useful.  Your mileage may vary. If your scans still look awful, plug betterscanning into your search engine and go buy a new film holder.  Everyone that's ever used those aftermarket jobbies (that I could find, anyway) says they see a marked improvement.  As it is apparent from even web sized photos that they're designed and constructed better than the OEM GARBAGE, I can see why. For real black and white film (not the chromagenic C-41 process stuff, scan that stuff just like color, only with Image Type set to 16 bit grayscale) turn off all the adjustment options except possibly Unsharp Mask.  Of course, since you're going to be slowly going crazy in Photoshop with the Spot Healing Brush taking out all the dust, you might as well turn that off too, since even at Medium the Unsharp Mask sometimes gets a bit of aliasing on diagonal lines. I reiterate: You could not pay me enough to own another Epson product."

Let me address some of the issues that have been raised: 1) Head size: my head size is 23"" in diameter, which is a large or 7 1/4 hat size. The headsets come with 2 types (hard plastic and bendable rubber) of fittings and the fittings come in 4 sizes. I used the largest, bendable rubber one and it's loose on me ... but I like it like that. 2) Sound quality: it sounds great to me. I have iTunes on my laptop at work and when I need to zone out the other office noises, I put these on and can get a couple hrs of focussed work done ... my ears don't hurt after that. I have also walked away to get print jobs ... 25 feet away and the reception is the same ... no background noise, no hissing, no skipping, etc. Another bonus is the volume control buttons ... 10 settings ... and it definitely gets loud enough to be too loud for me. I have also used these on flights to watch DVDs ... again, my ears were okay after watching a movie. Also, they're great for inflight movies because you can walk away from your seat (to stretch out or go to the bathroom) and still hear what's going on in the movie. Overall, I'm very pleased with these headphones and highly recommend them."

Even with the longest band, they pulled uncomfortably.  The actual earpiece/over the ear loop isn't very flexible either.  Then, the range (advertised at 10 METERS) is way overestimated.  I could only get to about 8 FEET with constant sound.  At 10 FEET, I got drop outs.  The sound itself wasn't bad, although at soft moments, you could hear a slight hiss.

At 39.99 with free shipping its the best price I could find if you are buying from California. Edit: The card works great with media but there seems to be an issue with OS X sleep. When the card is connected to the Macbok Pro it seems to prevent it from going to sleep. The work around is to eject the card . Wait for the MBP to go to sleep, then put the card back in.

BUT while an SD card is inserted into the EC slot and your machine goes to sleep or you re-open the lid to do some work again, it gives you an ""illegal device removal"" type error. Doesn't interfere with functionality, but something you will need to live with unless there is an (unlikely) firmware update released to eliminate the problem.

If I reinsert the SD card, I have to physically eject the reader from the express card slot and reinsert it.  If the reader is installed in the slot without any memory card in it, then the reader shows up as a ""drive"" in the windows explorer interface -- much like a CD drive or floppy drive show up even if no media is present.   I mention all of this because it is slightly different behavior than my old PCMCIA reader. Given that it shows up in explorer even when no media is inserted, I assume there are active components on the board that are drawing some power. This may have a marginal effect on battery life, so when I'm on a long plane ride, I often disable or eject the card reader. Unfortunately, neither SIIG's web page nor Amazon's give a lot of technical info about power consumption, etc.  I would like to know more about the power draw.  I would also like to know if I can just eject the SD card at any time, or if it's necessary to stop the reader via the system tray; I didn't find the answer in the documentation."

I don't know why I keep attempting to purchase your products other than the fact that I keep hoping a company which I use to respect will stop continuing to produce malfunctioning disk drives which are difficult to set up and don't work properly once you do. This is disgraceful since I have purchased LaCie, Acomdata, Seagate, BusLInk, as well as other drives over the same period of time and have no problem having my system recognize them and using them. A true ""plug and play"" scenario. This has never been the case with Western Digital drives. In this particular case I purchased a 400GB MyBook premium with both USB and Firewire capablilites. In any other situation I would expect to plug my drive into my Firewire port and have the drive be recognized and made immediately available for use. To my dismay, your installation procedure says I need to set up with the USB port and then the Firewire drivers would be made available to the system. By the way, if you don't have a USB port available on the system the start up guide instructs you to go to the WDC web site to download the Firewire drivers. (Wouldn't it have been convenient to include a 5 cent CD in the package which included the drivers, since when you go on your web site there are no clearly discernibe links to Firewire drivers.) It then instructs you to turn the drive off, hook up the Firewire ports and the drive would work properly. It did not! And WHAT BRILLIANT ENGINEER EVER FIGURED OUT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD WAY TO INSTALL A DRIVE (so much for the concept of ""Plug and Play"".) Once the drive was installed as a Firewire drive the unit would not stay recognized in the disk pool array. In the middle of a backup it cancelled saying the drive was no longer available! It was then I decided I did not want to trust this inferior engineering to my important system backups. I returned the drive, bought a Seagate and it is working perfectly. I plugged it in to my Firewire ports, started it up, it was recognized with no problems and has performed my system backup flawlessly. I have learned my lesson about purchasing Western Digital drives. I won't do it again. I think it is shameful you put out products like this and wonder if you need to take a closer at your competition to see HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. It is certainly a disgrace for your company to produce the, dare I say, JUNK which you produce. A lost customer forvever."

Amazon.com's image of it is that of the Titanium version of the lens introduced with the all Titanium M7; the lens actually resembles more closely a vintage 1960s 50mm Summilux in its appearance, with a detachable lens hood too. However, its performance is leagues ahead of its vintage predecessor, especially wide open at f 1.4 - though the other apertures offer superb performance too - and close up, due to the floating element, aspherical element and high refraction glass elements in the current Summilux's design. Although this lens is designed as a potential collectible along with the new LHSA commemorative Leica MP3 rangefinder camera, its list price is only a few hundred dollars more than the list price for the current 50mm Summilux ASPH M lens."

So, when I found out that this system has a wireless speaker I surely wanted to try it out. I already knew that wireless speaker could never be as good as the wired ones, and I was right. There is a low Hissing sound/noise that the rear speaker gives out. If you are watching a Pro logic movie with no action then you will hear the hissing clearly. Sound from the woofer and front speaker is outstanding. I debated for two weeks on whether I should return the system or not. But finally decided not to, the convenience I have with the wireless speaker outweighed the hissing. I have got used to the hissing noise and I would not notice it unless I want to. Placing the speaker little further away would also solve the problem. Pros: * Wireless rear speaker (R & L combined in one) * 5 DVD changer almost plays everything * Excellent Bass * Excellent picture quality, best I have seen so far in a DVD. * Wireless rear can be used with Ipod or PC to transmit sound to the main system. Cons: * Can't use Wifi or 2.4 Ghz Cordless phone when the wireless rear speaker is on. * Slight Hissing sound in the rear speaker * Combination of rear left and right into one massive speaker (could be a benefit in terms of convenience) Overall Conclusion: Buy it if you don't like wiring, all other drawbacks will fade out with time. UPDATE: Change the frequency of your wireless router from the default channel 6 to the highest channel 11, this may solve the Wi Fi interference issue."

The sound quality when playing this was very good. Highly recommendable for someone looking to improve their movie-watching experience at an affordable price. Next system comparable to the capabilities and features of this one comes for at least an extra couple hundred dollars."

526573,A10KODCGJQ8ZTT,0,1,19,B000F36GHI,8/2/2006,1,22,29,Don't bother,"I found this system in what I thought was a great bundle: the SC-HT643W at Sam's for a very reasonable price.  It's basically this system in a box with a second room ""front"" unit.  The instructions are usable, but give the impression of having been translated to English by someone not familiar with the product.  The setup of the wireless is not intuitive... the second room unit comes with a wireless card for the main unit, which the instructions warn you NOT to use (?), but to put in a safe place and save.  Additionally, the wireless has two killer flaws.  The lesser problem is that the wireless is just not very robust.  The stated range is 30+ feet, but I set the wireless rear and front up in the same 20 x 14 room as the main unit.  Standing in the ""path"" of the signal would block it completely (wireless speaker goes dead).  Worse yet, just walking along side of line of sight between the main and either wireless unit would result in the red ""W"" on the main flickering, and the speaker cutting in and out.  Which brings us closer to the worst problem.  The DVD player worked and sounded fine, but only gives 480p resolution via component (NO HDMI).  The ability to plug in a MP3 player to the musicports worked and sounded fine, but some of the options didn't make sense.  (Why select rear music port on the main, when you can do the same on the rear, and neither way plays over the main or remote front?) But the worst was when you used the unit to amplify your TV sound, which is what I bought it for.  There is no digital input, just left and right RCA jacks, so you connect two wires and switch the unit to AUX and it works.  But both wireless speakers make a noise... too low for a whine, and too high for a hum.  As far as I can determine, it is a design flaw, and it happens any time the wireless speaker are on and the main is set to AUX.  Please note that this is NOT wireless interference... it only happens when the main is set to AUX.  Muting the main makes it stop.  Changing the volume on the main does not affect it, unless you go to zero, which auto mutes.  In an effort to see if the main was picking up interference, I disconnected the audio input to the main, and nothing changed.  Finally, I disconnected the main unit entirely, set it by itself in the middle of the floor (8 feet+ from anything), unplugged everything else on that breaker, powered down the WIFI and cordless phones, and it did exactly the same thing.  When (and ONLY when) the main unit was on AUX, both wireless units made the same noise... which the main was obviously sending.  And I don't see any way that the main unit could have been receiving any interference.  I had our house as RF dead as I could manage, and the next nearest house is 100+ feet away.  So I put it all back in the box and returned it.  If you want to confirm my experience, be my guest.  But be warned.  Oh, and by the way... I'm not an acoustic snob or anything, but that ""open mike"" noise got real old, real fast.  I like the appearance and modularity of this unit, it just doesn't perform."

I invested in this product because I wanted to take full advantage of the wireless rear speakers.  It works great as long as you completely follow the disclaimer to NOT HAVE ANY SIGNAL DEVICE NEAR IT while you have it on.  I'm talking cell phones especially.  If you don't get those in the way of the transmission, then everything is peachy keen.  I know that's not the fault of the product itself, but just of the Technology itself.

It sounds great and is a great value for its price.  It is extremely convenient NOT to have wires to the rear speaker.  I do wish the rear volume was a bit louder, but again a minor problem for me. For those who have a wireless router (computer signal) you will likely get interference from the Panasonic Home Theater System.  I do not have the specs on the home theater system, but it must also run on wireless Channel 6, which is the same default signal for my wireless router.  If this is your problem (dropped wireless signal on computer), you will need to reconfigure your wireless router to another channel.  Usually a wireless router has channels 1-11.  I set mine to channel 1 and now both systems work fine."

They are not as advertised in most cases.  This products best feature is the wireless transciever, yet it has a few bugs, such as distance and how close speakers can be placed.  Too close and you get the ""Jimmy Hendricks"" feedback effect. This products downfall is that it really isn't a SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM as they would have you beleive. It is shy 2 rear speakers, and yet the on-screen setup and the manual show a different setup...STRANGE. I though it was a shipping error, but, no...it really is missing 2 speaker connection ports for what most systems call the rear speakers. The sub woofer is great and the over all sound quality is good, minus the speaker issue. If you want a better product in ths line of pre-HDDVD players (5 up), check out Samsung's sister system.

Not a very strong rear (wireless) speaker, but okay.  It was adequate.  In September 2007 however, the rear speaker stopped working.  Today the whole system stopped working altogether.   It tries to power up but quickly shuts down with a display that reads F61.  The User's Manual says when you have a F61 error to, ""Check and correct the speaker cable connections.  If this does not fix the problem, consult the dealer.""  Yep, it didn't sound good to me either.  Not only are the speaker cable connections fine ~ EVERY cable and EVERY connection is just as it should be.  It had a one-year warranty so we missed coverage by just about a month.  I googled ""panasonic f61"" to find a veritable PLETHORA of info out there, NONE of it good.  Apparently the dreaded F61 error is the ""kiss of death"", not only for this model but for others made by Panasonic as well.  This error has happened to MANY ~ some reporting it's an overheat situation, others saying it's shorted out, others saying the unit shuts itself down to prevent a power surge that will blow out the amps.  No one, apparently not even Panasonic, seems able to FIX the thing!  Individual REPAIR SHOPS reported buying multiple replacement parts that had been recommended by Panasonic only to find out one by one over a period of months that none of them would repair the unit.  People said that they waited endlessly for a replacement refurb.  One person reported Panasonic wanted to charge them $250 to repair the unit.  (Remember, this was originally $209.99)  I lived thru this VERY problem with a Brother all-in-one printer and I know how these kiss of death errors work.  So I'm saving myself a lot of aggravation and just going to take a trip to the dump on my way out shopping for another wireless HTIB.  Needless to say it will NOT be made by Panasonic.  No surprise here that I do NOT recommend this product at all ESPECIALLY learning this is in no way an uncommon occurence and Panasonic seems not only unwilling to stand behind their products but unaware of what to do to even FIX the thing!  Before buying any Panasonic Surround Sound/Home Theater/DVD players may I strongly suggest that you first Google Panasonic F61???"

Well I looked at an awful lot of different HTIB (Home Theatre in a Box) systems before deciding on this one.  My old tuner/receiver Pioneer system finally died leaving me with no surround sound, music or stereo at all.  The biggest complaints that most reviewers had was the lack of a powered subwoofer,a hum in the rear wireless speakers and interference with home wireless networks.  Well, I got a good price and decided to give it a try anyway. Here is what I am happy to report: 1. I will admit that a powered subwoofer is DEFINITELY the way to go.  Luckily for me, my old system had a 10"" powered subwoofer which works perfectly and really makes this system KICK. 2. The wireless speaker system works flawlessly.  NO HUM, NO NOISE and it is over 35 feet away from the receiver. Anyone who is experiencing a hum, is probably getting it as a result of a poor electrical ground in their home. 3. The wireless network interference issue - well I must say, this was a bit of a problem for about 10 minutes.  A simple change of the broadcast channel on my Linksys router (actually had to try a few times since others in my neighborhood have the same router and I needed to not conflict with them) and this worked flawlessly - actually I am doing the review wireless NOW.  The multi DVD player is great for my fickle 2 -1/2 year old.  Her current favorite Disney DVD's sit waiting for us to easily switch from one movie to the next at the touch of a button. ONE THING I WISH WERE BETTER - The remote is NOT a universal type, it will only control some models of Panasonic TV's.  My Panasonic DVR remote controls my TV and inputs but this one does not.  Just one more remote to put on the table and one more reason to upgrade to a REAL universal remote. Overall, this is an incredible system for the price.  All features work well and if you want to have your regular TV, Cable and any other components attached to your TV work with the surround, simply plug the TV output into the AUX input and select music surround. I think if your expectations are appropriate for the price - you will be VERY HAPPY with this system. Lastly - thank you Panasonic for the full 1 year warranty (not 30,60 or 90 days like your competitors)."

This gives you a new tech support person, who talks you thru the reinstall from that point.  If you're having a hardware problem, the reinstall probably fails.  They look up your new problem.

But it does fit into the side window cigarette lighters just fine. When plugged in, it has a red light that comes on and a faint buzzing sound. Didn't work at first, but then I notice that I didn't plug my laptop all the way in. It's difficult to plug it in with the adapter in the lighter, but if I plug it into the adapter first and then plug the adapter into the lighter, everything works fine. The adapter is not merely designed for Dell laptops. Anything that takes a regular plugin will work, two prong or three prong appliances that use under 150W of electricity. I am happy with the product and will recommend it to anyone."

We got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files. A couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them. PROS : - incredibly easy to use ( you don't need to teach anybody ) - fast for PDF scanning - great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled ) - very small, perfect for a desk - good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke CONS : - quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs. - not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ). I strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents. If you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better."
526537,A3618YIJ1CNHXZ,0,1,49,B000F3YSQ4,5/21/2006,5,26,27,An Incredible Value to Help Achieve a Paperless Office,"I have to say that I am incredibly impressed by the ScanSnap S500. It provides excellent quality scans that are lighting fast. The settings are pretty easy to customize and most things occur automatically when the scan takes place. It automatically scans to PDF Document format and with a little extra processing time, will run the scan through the supplied OCR(Optical Character Recognition) software to create a PDF that is fully searchable. The scanner scans both sides of a page simultaneously within the same amount of time it takes to scan just the front. So if you are scanning at Normal quality (very adequate for most situations), and have double sided originals, you will achieve roughly 36 pages per minute. The greatest value is that the Scansnap comes with a bundled version of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Standard (a program that usually sells for around $300). This allows you not only to create and edit PDF's from your scan's but also any Office documents, including Outlook Emails. Acrobat automatically integrates with the Office Suite on installation, which makes it incredibly easy to use Acrobat in the Office applications. One feature that I was really impressed with the ability to convert an entire Outlook folder into a PDF document. Back to the scanner. I cannot comment on the dedicated OCR software or the business card software that is provided as I haven't tried to scan a document yet into Word or Excel directly or a business card. The documentation does state that the business card software uses OCR to enable you to transfer the contact information directly to Outlook, which would be a huge time savings for a business person who collects several cards a day. One minor drawback is that its small footprint only accepts pages as wide as 8.5 inches. You can scan wider formats, such as 11x17 inches, but you need to fold the paper and use the carrier sheet (Plastic sheet that you insert the folded page into to scan). But this is a minor point as most of the things I see myself scanning are regular paper size or narrower."
526535,AV9SPTCKCZH9H,0,1,47,B000F3YSQ4,1/21/2007,5,6,6,"A Great ""Pro-Sumer"" Scanner","Summary: I've had this scanner for seven months, and it is terrific.  It has (literally) revolutionized the way I think about paperwork and documents in my home office.  A friend recommended it to me after using the predecessor for many years, and he and I both recommend it very highly. Speed and Quality: The ScanSnap S500 is a great scanner for documents, bills, paperwork, etc., and the occasional photo.  It is fast and has excellent scan quality, which is selectable.  I choose to run at a moderate resolution scan, since mostly I scan bills and documents, and it scans faster this way (and uses less disk space).  Scan quality/speed is user-selectable, though not on a per-document basis - if you want a different resolution, you have to change the default scan quality, do your scan, and change it back.  But I've chosen a moderate-range which works well for nearly everything I need, so I rarely have to change the settings. Note that the highest-quality scans use quite a bit more disk space than lower-quality, so you'll want to evaluate how important the quality is to you.  But if you need the quality, it's there for you. Size: The unit has an amazingly small form factor.  The photos make it look bigger, but once it's on your desk it uses little space.  And if you take off the bottom paper guide it's even more compact. Ease of Setup: Very simple and easy to set up.  It plugs in via USB 2.0, just hit the Scan button and off it goes.  It signals the attached PC, which initiates the scan operation (and the optional Character Recognition - see below). Included Software: One of the great bonuses is that this product includes a fully-functional version of Adobe Acrobat. This is a great ""plus"", because the documents are stored in PDF format making them easy to access and search later.  And I've found many uses for Acrobat that I never imagined before.  (It probably is part of the reason this scanner is expensive, but a good copy of Acrobat will run you over $250 by itself.)  You can save it to other formats, but I've never tried it; PDF does everything I need. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is also included.  This has proven to be a great add-on.  This product identifies text, and includes it as part of the PDF document.  This allows you to search scanned PDF documents for text - which is a HUGE plus!  The only downside is that the scanning is slow and takes a while to complete - a dialog box shows you the progress, but you can cancel the OCR if you don't want to wait.  A faster PC will really help here, since it's CPU-intensive. Automatic Feeder: If I had any complaints, it's with the automatic feeder.  It jams from time to time until you learn the tricks of how to make it feed well.  Yes, you can feed 20-30 pages at one time, but just dropping a bunch of paper will result in multiple pages coming through at one time (and the scanner can detect this, and signal a paper jam).  Here's how to avoid this: Rifle the page ends before scanning.  You want to actually BEND the pages significantly, so that each page has a good ""kink"" in each one.  You'll think you're way overdoing it, but trust me - just a little ""ruffle"" on the edges won't do it.  By rifling or twisting each page slightly, it feeds most documents easily and automatically. Is this a nuisance?  Yes.  A big one?  No.  I've grown accustomed to it, and most of the time I'm only scanning 1-2 pages anyway. Don't try to feed documents with holes in them, or which are very thick or  are adhesive-backed - they'll jam.  It's easy to clear a jam if it happens, but the page might get a little bunched up in the process.  Also, vit only handles pages 8.5 inches wide, so don't plan on using it for 11x17 or poster-size docs unless you want to cut it into smaller sizes.  But it does smaller size documents (post cards, receipts, etc.) just fine. How I Use It: I now scan every document that comes in - bills, invoices, check stubs, financial records, you name it - and shred the original afterward.  No more piles of documents to file every December.  No more digging for old financial records in boxes - it's all online and ready to go.  Just be sure to back it all up carefully.  If security is a concern, you can apply a password to the PDF documents as you save them, to provide a measure of protection.  It has made my office nearly paperless, except for the shredder bin.  :) This is a great scanner for the ""Pro-Sumer"", the consumer with a need for professional-style handling of documents, or even the small office or business with reasonable document needs.  For bigger offices, with large volumes to scan, I'd consider a more professional document-fed unit, but for many people the ScanSnap S500 is the perfect solution.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
526534,A3BQXCZIRDMID3,0,1,46,B000F3YSQ4,10/20/2006,2,14,17,"Fancy features, but bottom line...poor performance","While a nice product packed with great features when it works, the bottom line is that it does NOT support TWAIN drivers, meaning you can not scan through ANY application other than ScanSnap. BIG MINUS. Second minus is JAMS, JAMS, JAMS. I have barely used this machine, but the double feeds are incredible (the rollers are new and the machine is clean). I even tried using high grade color laser copier paper, but STILL double feeds big time! Upon occasion, I get a good feed, and I am so thankful for that. If you are planning to do some serious office organizing with various types of paper, sizes and paper weights, skip this product and go for a ADF flatbed scanner. This baby will JAM up your day and consume all of your time with fiddling, reorganizing the misfeeds and clearing jams. Think deeply before buying this one. Also, with an ADF flatbed, you can scan books, and unusual documents (thin paper, very heavy paper) that an ADF (and the ScanSnap) won't process by simply lifting the lid of the ADF and taking the scan directly on the glass. With ScanSnap, you are screwed."

As the IT manager, I look for ""low maintenance"" and ease of use. The average employee who has never used a scanner finds this very easy due to the software. It can be set up to ""scan to a PDF attachment in email"" or other options, such as having default save to locations like the network. I have never had to have one repaired or and other type of maintenance. Scanning both sides at the same time is very fast and helpful. Very pleased with all the Scansnaps I have where I work. This is one scanner that really will help employees reduce the use of paper who aren't challenged to otherwise."
526531,AIBRTGBN07D6A,0,0,43,B000F3YSQ4,8/2/2007,5,4,4,"Finally, a decent scanner","Our ofice has dozens of HP Scanjets and Xerox Documates and, as the IT guy, I hate every one.  Feeders wear out, get jammed, pull multiple pages through, and are slow.  I decided to go with the Fujistu ScanSnap because of all the great reviews, despite the higher price.  Our budget doesn't allow for a copier scanner or a high priced workstation scanner.  For the price, the ScanSnap is excellent. 1. This scanner is very small.  It is only slightly wider than a letter-sized sheet of paper, and when everything is folded up, it is half as long.  Unlike other scanners, I can easily find room for it at any desk in our office.  It is so small it could even sit on top of a workstation. 2. This scanner is VERY easy to use.  Previous scanners had buttons all over them for different functions.  You would press the regular scan button, and then have to wait for the scanner's software to start up, the lamp to warm up, the image to preview (I HATE previewing the image!), and the slow process of scanning.  The Fujitsu ScanSnap has two buttons.  A power button (which I never use since I leave the unit on all the time) and a big green SCAN button.  Put the paper in, press the button, and literally within about 5 seconds it scans the image, and in another 3 or 4 it converts it to PDF and saves it.  It is amazing how insanely fast this scanner is. 3. The Software provided by Fujitsu is great.  It is very unobtrusive and easy to use.  I scan most of my docs to PDF, so after it is done scanning, I just use their included software, which shows previews of the actual scans.  I can click an ""e-mail"" button and 2 seconds later it opens my email program with the scan already attached.  MUCH faster than scanning directly from Acrobat.  It's also great that I can use their software standalone and don't have to deal with Acrobat at all, which is incredibly bloated in version 7. It comes with some other software, such as an OCR reader which I haven't tried, and a program called CardMinder which you can use to scan in business cards.  It will scan the card, use the OCR reader to categorize the contact information, as well as save an actual image of the card.  I don't use this program either but it definitely seems useful for people who receive a lot of cards. It also comes with Acrobat Standard 7.0 so you don't have to buy Adobe's software. Overall, this might be the best piece of office equipment I've purchased.  If you are looking for a powerful scanner at a mid-range price it is great, and I definitely recommend it for anyone who does a lot of scanning to PDF.  It is worth the extra $250 or so compared to the HP scanners simply for the copy of Acrobat and the speed of use."

I just want to  point out that this product includes Acrobat 7 for Macintosh.  If you plan on  using this scanner with, say DevonThinkPro Office, you don't need Acrobat as DTPO has a (very good) OCR engine built right in.  Consider the FI-5110 instead.

526529,A1I3ETYWWMUWWC,0,1,41,B000F3YSQ4,2/10/2007,5,3,3,Well worth it,"This is an amazing device, and a good deal when bundled with a full copy of Adobe Acrobat Standard (v.7 at this writing). It scans both sides of a document in a single pass, and the included document manager software (not Acrobat) automatically recognizes page size and color, and deletes blank pages.  This means you don't have to worry about settings, just scan as you go. You can mix single and double sided documents. You can vary a number of settings, if you want to, including simplex or duplex scanning, color or black and white, and quality (resolution). You can also set the scanner to scan a group of pages (up to 50), stop, reload the feeder, and continue as a part of a single document.  Of course more pages, better scan quality and color recognition results in larger file sizes. The Scansnap also scans photographs with nice results, albeit as .pdf documents.  If you want a high quality photo scanner, look elsewhere.  This is not a TWAIN device.  It's a SOHO dedicated document scanner. I have a high capacity digital copier/scanner/printer/fax machine, but the Scansnap is small enough to keep next to my desk, is more versatile. and easier to use.  It's a bit slower, but I can scan and organize as I go.  The result is that the Scansnap saves huge amounts of time. This is a mature product, with mature software.  It works, and makes going paperless much easier! (And you DO want to go paperless!!)"

I own a paper filled small business and was looking for a scanner to make the change to paperless. I bought an All-in-One machine and the scanner was terrible.  I went to a clients office and they had a fujitsu, so I looked into them.  I found this scanner and decided to buy from Amazon because they were the only retailer who guaranteed they would return the item if I was dissatisfied without a restocking fee.  This machine scans both sides in color and is fast.  The quality, in many cases, is better than the original itself. I still can't believe the  FULL version of Adobe Acrobat 7 is included with the package. The footprint of the unit is so small and the colors match my dell pc's perfectly.  I was so impressed with the machine that I bought one for my house. Recently, I have taken advantage of the $[...] rebate that fujitsu.com offers.  In addition, I had a minor software problem where I was instructed to call Fujitsu.  I barely waited on hold and the people who helped me were American and didn't even take any information regarding the machine until the matter was resolved.  Turned out the problem was caused by me.   I STRONGLY encourage everyone to buy this machine and there is no one better to buy it from than Amazon.com.  Even though this machine qualified for super saver shipping, I had it the very next day, believe it or not, I did.  I was AMAZED by AMAZON. Plus, there was no tax, a $[...] rebate from Fujitsu and a return guarantee. What else more could you possible ask for?"

A certain amount of wishing just a little more thought had been put into the design, manufacture, documentation, or support of the device. A certain number of sighs as you 'just shut up and deal' with the major or minor shortcomings of the device. Not so the ScanSnap. I've had mine over a year now and have scanned thousands of pages - everything from bank statements to daily scratchpad notes to books I cut into single sheets in order to scan them. It does what it is supposed to do, does it well, and does it without hassle. It's very durably built, and you can get replacement parts for the moving parts which may wear or jam over time. I have yet to experience such a problem, though - I just note this because I fully expect this thing to be working well a decade from now.

I bought it last year to use at home, with the goal of reducing the amount of paper I keep to the absolute minimum by scanning everything to PDF files.  That project didn't go into high gear, though, until recently.  I've been very pleased with my ScanSnap's performance.  Ups and downs: *Paper jams:  There have been some, usually with a stack of paper of mixed widths or other usual characteristics.  But I've never used any paper-feeding machine, including large ones at work, that never had a jam.  The ScanSnap's performance during my recent scanning blitz was very stable overall. *Speed:  Excellent.  Yesterday I demonstrated this to a friend by putting a double-sided legal sized document through the ScanSnap and was reminded by her response, just how fast this little thing is. *Lack of TWAIN drivers:  Really hasn't been a problem for me, but Fujitsu now offers at least one similar scanner with TWAIN support - the . *XP to Vista transition - delay:  Boo. Hiss.  Fujitsu did not make Vista compatible drivers and software for the S500 available until July 2007.  Meaning that from March 2007 when I purchased a Vista-equipped PC until July, I couldn't use the ScanSnap. *XP to Vista - performance:  Improved.  It may be due to my more intensive use of the ScanSnap since July making me more adept with the interface, but I believe the ScanSnap works a bit better with Vista than it did with XP. *Elegance and ease of use:  Sweet.  This is a well-designed piece of equipment, which has such a small footprint when closed that I usually just leave it on my desk.  It turns on automatically when you open it although one of its two (!) buttons is a power button.  It warms up very fast when turned on. *Versatility:  It's great for documents, which is what I bought it for.  I haven't tried to use it for any serious scanning of photos or drawings.  I have my old HP flatbed scanner for that stuff. *Weight loss:  Just joking.  But I have, in just a couple of days' work using the ScanSnap, disposed of about 200 pounds of old documents - that's 8 storage boxes' worth - from my home office.  I tossed half into the recycle dumpster and had the other half shredded because of sensitive content and concerns about identity theft.  And it's so easy to scan documents as they arrive that as long as my ScanSnap is working, I won't build up such a mass of paper junk again."

If you need to scan one page at a time, it's fine, and decently priced. So I was mostly happy at first.  But if you have to use the page feeder, this machine really stinks.  It pulls through 2-3 pages at a time, can't handle bond paper, can't handle paper that's had staples removed, can't handle paper that's not perfectly smooth. So when you want to scan a multi-page document, you usually have to photocopy it first to get pristine pages, and even then your odds are only about 50/50 that it will feed properly. All in all, I wouldn't buy this one again, and would recommend against it for anyone who will use it more than once a week to scan multi-page documents.  Mark my words, it will make you crazy."

Small footprint, looks sharp, and boy does it scan! I have been trying to reduce a cabinet of home files using a flatbed scanner. You know the routine, place a sheet on the scanner, press scan, wait, wait, open the scanner, turn the page over, press scan, wait, wait, click next, try to recall if its time to turn the page or scan a new page....etc. Well with the ScanSnap, this labor is a thing of the past! I just reduced a stack of bills, statements, and other mail into neat pdfs! Here's how I did it...I put the CD into my computer, installed the software. Put the Adobe CD into the computer, installed Acrobat (full version no less!). Plugged in the ScanSnap and put in on my desk, followed the installation procedures. No hassles--it went in like a champ on my Windows XP system. Then I opened the top and bottom flip out cover, inserted my bills into the ScanSnap hopper, and pressed the scan button. It took 3 minutes to scan 5 statements duplex and in color! (Telephone bill was 6 pages front and back, Investment summary was 6 pages front and back landscape, Mutual Fund summary was 8 pages front and back, others were 2 or 3 pages). Until you see this for yourself, it is hard to believe--especially since I was used to my really slow process of before on my flatbed scanner. I was AMAZED! Really, really enthused! Note: I pressed Scan for each new stack of bills. Each time you press scan, you get a new pdf. It took me longer to grab the statements off my desk than it took the ScanSnap to read the images. I found myself looking for more stuff to scan since it was soooo fun and easy. After I was done scanning, I renamed each scan to my filing system (statement ending year mm dd - name of bill), closed up the scanner, and shredded the stack of paper. The ScanSnap Organizer is easy to use and easy to see thumbnails of each document for easy filing (They call it a cabinet...). Oh I should tell you that the ScanSnap in the closed position looks awesome on my desk. When you open it, it automatically turns on with a cool blue light to let you know it is ready. And so when you are done, just close it up, and it turns off! Great idea! I was most impressed because the ScanSnap automagically corrected the orientation of the output even when the paper was printed in Landscape, or on narrow paper, or was printed for top to bottom binding or left to right binding. (My description is not very good, but trust me, this was fascinating to see the scanner understand the orientation of each page and correct it automatically with no intervention required in addition to deleting blank pages too.) Each document came out properly oriented and beautifully scanned! I got so excited, I wanted to stay up all night emptying my filing cabinet into this thing! (BTW, I bought a Fellowes MS-450C. A beautifully quiet, fast and powerful shredder with a host of features...it compliments to this scanner--check it out!) Oh, and the free Amazon shipping! Wow! My product arrived in two days! And I live in Hawaii where shipping is typically expensive and slow. Not here at Amazon! And don't forget the $50 rebate which is good until 30 June 2007. But wait! There's more. This scanner comes with Adobe Acrobat...the FULL version! (Mine came with Ver 7.0) Acrobat ALONE costs about the price of this Scanner! So if you have been thinking about getting Adobe Acrobat, why not get this instead? You'll get Acrobat and a free scanner (if you think of it that way...) Actually, I must also confess...I purchased Kodak Scanners (I can't recall the model number now) for my office. They were Over $1400 each...and yet, the ScanSnap has them beat hands down for the smooth operation of the software, the fast scanning, and the compact size. The Fujitsu product is just better in every regard.  O.K. maybe not every regard--the Fujitsu doesn't have a flatbed option--but the Fujitsu suits MY needs better! I must also tell you that I first saw the previous version of this product in Japan over 5 years ago. At that time, the official documentation said the scanner would not handle letter size paper, only A4. I wrote to Fujitsu and asked them to consider adding letter size...Well my wish has come true! Thanks Fujitsu! It has been a while since a product has captured my enthusiasm this powerfully. Try the ScanSnap, I think you'll like it! -D"

The docs come out stunning looking and with fantastic OCR accuracy. Knowing Fujistu, when I saw this product, the ScanSnap 500 I was thinking, wow, here is the answer to my slow mind-numbing misery. I had it immediately shipped to me and set it up and ran some docs through it.  They look terrible, and there are merely account statements, some with patterns on the background of the company logo or something. The pages look almost nothing like the originals, and the text recognition missed substantially more than feeding the docs to Acrobat and letting it parse the page.  I tried scanning the file as you would a picture with very little compression, and the pages and OCR still come out terrible. The document feeders seems to work, and it is a cute form factor, very nice for my desk, but the bottom line is that if I cannot have this work without coming up to speed as the engineers in product development, then what is the point? Fujitu's web site has no TWAIN drivers for this scanner so I cannot get the benefit of assuming that I will perfect the scans and then suck them into Acrobat from inside the program. This little box is really terrible from my one day with it in setup and tweaking.  By the time I got even a decent,but far inferior image from the Scansnap the scanning speed had slowed to a crawl? I am off the the usual computer stores to try to find and alternative to this dog."

When I upgraded the computers in my office this time, I bought Dells - against the advice of my computer consultant. When they came, they didn't work. I bought the deluxe service package - the one where they come on site if they need to. Here's how that works: 1. If you call, 3 of 4 times you're on hold for 15 minutes, then there is a click and you're disconnected. 45 minutes on hold, then someone picks up the receiver and hangs up on you. If you call 40 times this will happen 30 of the 40. 2. Once you get them, they will say it's a software problem and it's not their responsibility - call Microsoft. If you call Microsoft, they tell you that, since you bought it from Dell, they are the reseller, and you need to deal with them on all operating system issues. 3. You call back to Dell, and they try to sell you more support and refuse to address the issue (after hanging up on you three times first). 4. I finally called Geeks on Call - they looked at the machines - said it was a 'bad build' and that it was a Dell problem. I paid another $500 to them to get the machines running. 5.

There are literally hundreds of bags to choose from, but the reviews on this bag at the Apple Store website were inspiring, as was the design, and the testimonals on the Brenthaven site itself. Now the bag itself *IS* a nice bag. It's certainly sturdy, there's no questioning that, and I feel extremely confident that my MacBook will survive in there unscathed. The problem is, the bag is big, and yet it doesn't hold very much, at least by my standards. The ""CORE"" protection system inside takes up a lot of room, and of course, the MacBook itself, while thin, is big, because of the beautiful widescreen display on it. The bag itself weights about three pounds, the MacBook another five and a half, plus then the charger, so you're talking about nine pounds right off the bat to be carrying all the time. The bag I had before this, a Jansports green ""messenger brief"" which I could sling over my shoulder, or carry like a briefcase, just like this, was, and still is a great bag. It held a lot of things, and I would pack it thusly. I can't do that with this Brenthaven bag. If I have my MacBook in this bag, I can fit, say, two half liter bottles of water, the MacBook charger, my cell phone charger, and two 120-page spiral notebooks for class. And it's an uncomfortable fit then, and the bag is very bulky then. I can't fit my copy of The Times in there either anymore, with said items. With my Jansport bag, I would usually carry around notebooks for school, two bottles of water, The Times, random food items for the day to save money (can of soup, pouch of microwave rice, things in a Pyrex glass container so they wouldn't get crushed), along with other odd ends. I can't do this anymore. So, again, while the Brenthaven bag is nice, don't expect to carry much in it other than the MacBook itself, and a notebook or two, espcially if you use the mesh holdings inside to store things like bottles of water. The back of the bag has a pouch to store stuff in, but don't expect to put much in it because to close it (via velcro), it can't be bulging out much. Also, items in this pouch, if not flat, will beat against your leg if slung across your shoulder. There's also a front zipper pouch which doesn't hold much, and is annoying to use. I'm probably going to return this, and purchase the ""Brenthaven Metro,"" which is really just to hold the MacBook itself only, and nothing else. Then I'll just have to carry around two bags each day, probably just carrying the MacBook around like a suitcase."

526445,A2SNEHITVN6AED,0,0,44,B000FA1G26,8/5/2006,2,21,22,"If they're going to make it, MAKE IT RIGHT!","I don't get why companies make products that are feature rich, but don't send them home with test groups to fine-tune the detailed problems. I had to send this unit back because it was so non-intuitive and not user-friendly at all.  The pause live tv function was useless, and I encountered a bug that locked my system up every time (see this product's discussion forum below).  How many more bugs might I find?  This thing had to go back. The feeling I got from this unit was that Toshiba tried to implement as many features as possible (by as many different people) without making any attempt to integrate them. For instance, the TV Guide On-screen feature was most important to me, as it was a guide that comes over the air or cable for free -- no subscriptions required, and no digital cable box required.  Great!  However, it was as if TV Guide just sent Toshiba an applet to run on the machine that was basically set in its own world as far as the RD-XS35 was concerned.  The only integration was the fact that I could press the record button to record something from the guide.  The guide was slow, awkward, and hard to use.  Info from the guide was not provided on a given channel unless you started the TV guide applet again. The second most important feature to me was being able to ""pause live tv"" like a Tivo box, or a cable or satellite DVR does.  Their implementation of this feature is HORRIBLE.  It is nerfed to the point that this feature is useless.  You see, in order for you to pause what you're watching, you have to enter ""timeslip mode"" which takes about 10 seconds to start! It will start recording the channel, bump you back 10 seconds, and LOCK YOU ON THAT CHANNEL UNTIL YOU EXIT THE MODE!  You can, at that point, pause, REW, and FF what you're watching.  But you have to exit the mode (which takes another 10 seconds and two confirmation messages) to change the channel and restart the whole process over again elsewhere.  INCREDIBLY dissapointing and worthless. Lastly, there is a ""menu"" button, an ""EASY NAVI menu"" button, a ""content menu"" button and a ""Quick menu"" button all on the remote, and all of which do different things, none of which are integrated.  What the heck?  Can they make operation of this thing more confusing?  It was as if some engineer on one side of their R&D building says ""ooh I have an idea for a main menu button"" and he puts in in.  Then another engineer on the other side of the building says ""oooh *I* have an idea for a menu button"" and he puts it in as well, but neither of them talk to each other at any point in the process. There are 13 thousand ways to enter the setup menu of the device but only one way to exit it.  With the exit button?  NO, that would make too much sense.  You have to open a hatch on the remote and find the setup button in the lower left hand corner and press it.  Great.  And there are a million buttons under that hatch, none of which seem to do anything useful. The ""info"" button really pretty much does nothing, except in the TV Guide mode. My advice - save your money for something that actually does what you need it to do.  Why spend so much money just to be frustrated?  Private DVRs are about to boom big time, and *someone* out there is going to get it right.  Toshiba definitely did not."
526444,A26HV5UHJ61KEA,0,0,43,B000FA1G26,6/11/2006,4,14,14,Better than I hoped for,"Wanted to buy a hard drive based DVD recorder last year, but saw so many bad reviews of most brands/units that I decided to wait.  I bought a low end Toshiba recorder (D-R4) and have been happy with it.  Thus I decided to try this new model without benefit of reviews.  Had it a couple of weeks and I have to say I'm impressed.  I have experienced no problems.  The menu system is similar to my D-R4 so it was quick for me to learn.  The TV Guide took two days for 1st download, but has been perfect since (have Charter Cable). Have recorded to HD from TV Guide and burned to DVD; copied existing DVD to HD, edited and burned new DVD; and copied programs from two existing DVD's to HD, changed bit rate to fit them both on one DVD (unit calculated new bit rate for me automatically).  Editing out commercials on the HD is very straight forward.  High speed dubbing will burn a football game to DVD in about 10 minutes. In short, it has done everything I bought it to do flawlessly.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the pain of reorganizing the TV Guide Channels after the 1st download to match our cable box order and the copy protection on HBO, VCR tapes (that I'd like to archive to DVD), etc.  Of course I know that they pretty much have to implement the copy protection, but I don't like it anyway."
526443,AQWUZSDYO8VRA,0,0,42,B000FA1G26,5/12/2006,2,16,17,Surprised there were problems!,"I own many Toshiba products, including a new laptop, dvd players etc... When 2 different liteon 5045s both broke in 28 and 29 days respectfully, I decided to stick with a good brand that has worked for us over the years. I have to say they (Toshiba) thought of everything in the design of this unit. It is impressive when you read the manual and find out the many ways this unit may be customised for both; quality of audio and video (together and independantly!), and control of the appearance of the menu screens. The TV Guide aspect is one that should be able to be bypassed if one chooses to get around the problems associated with it. However, you must deal with it. After the first couple hours of viewing, we noticed that the sound would drop out for a split second. This problem is persistant and very annoying. Parts of words are completely missed. This does not make for good recording! The other major problem is that recordings fail right in the middle of the program. The message beeps twice and tells you to contact service if it persists. It has! Many times! As a result of the above problems, I am returning it. I may give another try at the same model. Haven't decided yet. On the whole, the shipping costs of the dvd recorders that have failed are enough to bleed anyone monetarily and time-wise. If I get another of the same model, I will add to this to let people know if I fared any better. ammended may 14th******** I finally got it to record a couple of movies and found another major problem that I did not have with the other dvd recorders we have owned. If you plan on recording from HBO, Showtime etc...DON'T!!!!!!!!!! It will not let you burn it to disk. All movies recorded on those channels are automatically ""write protected"". Unbelievable!!! Also, the picture quality is not as good as the ""no-name"" brands. I am done with Toshiba!"
526441,A231UV130LQ7HW,0,1,40,B000FA1G26,7/30/2006,2,14,15,Disappointing.,"I have only had this DVR/DVD Recorder for a few days, but so far I have found it not particularly user friendly.  I haven't used the DVD burner yet, so I'll only review the DVR part at the moment. I was really only looking for a DVD Recorder, but I love the DVR supplied by Cox cable and thought it would be great to have one in the bedroom.  The fan noise was a big concern since it was going in the bedroom.  So far, the fan has NOT shut off even with the unit in Standby mode.  I don't expect that it ever will.  It's pretty loud, but a very consistent white noise.  I would say it is softer than a bathroom exhaust fan, but louder than a ceiling fan on its highest speed, if that helps anyone.  I use those examples since those noises are also in the same proximity.  I will say that the fan noise is better than the noise from the cable DVR, which is a chattering noise from the hard drive since it is always recording and is much more annoying in a quiet room. The interface is very clunky compared to the cable DVR and ease of use in not even in the same continent as the cable DVR.  The TVGOS is terrible in my opinion because viewing other channels in the guide actually changes the channels in the guide, so you can't watch a program and surf the guide to see if something better is on.  That's the way it works on the cable DVR and we have become very spoiled by that function.  I also have not found a way to bring up info for the program currently being viewed in an unobtrusive way except to go all the way to the guide.  You'd think the INFO button on the remote would work that way.  Like I said early, we have become very spoiled by the cable DVR and I could go on an on about what functions it does better than this unit, but I don't have the time.  One more thing I will say is that I also don't like the inability to rewind live TV on a whim.  You have to remember to hit the Time Slip button when you start watching so you can rewind back to that point in the future. Finally, a reviewer complained that the audio was really low on the TV and I had a similar problem, but I believe the TV is the culprit.  I often find the audio low even with the volume turned up and believe it to be caused by the auto sound level feature on the TV (the one that keeps the sound at about the same level when you change channels or over an zealous advertiser comes on.  If I turn the TV off and then back on, the sound level is back to normal.  Now I just make sure the unit is on before turning on the TV (btw, it's a Samsung 32"" LCD HDTV).  I hope this helps. I will try to remember to update this review as I use more features.  At this point though, I can't say I'm very happy with this purchase.  From reading reviews of other manufacturer's similar units, I do believe that this unit is about as good as it gets in the mid-price range DVR/DVD Recorders, so I can't say that there is anything better."
526440,A207EL63X3MY5Z,0,0,39,B000FA1G26,2/12/2007,5,9,9,Best bang for the buck,"I had recently had my Panasonic E85H DVR/DVD die about two weeks ago and I was then in the market to remplace.  I've found that a DVR is something that I can't live without (OK I can, but why would you?) and I did want a replacement.  Given the issues with my past unit and some firmware issues I started looking at the Toshiba and without getting into other choices I'll jump into why I selected the XS35.  It has a HUGE hard drive (160 GB), which will store plenty of programs at the highest resolution, it has optical and component video out (so it matched my inputs well), it was significantly cheaper (although listed at $400 it can be had for around $310), and it comes with the TV Guide (like TIVO, but no monthly service fees).  The one thing that I felt was missing was a HDMI output (which is on the xs55, but it is a couple hundred more), but the picture quality is excellent on my HDTV (although the signal from the XS35 isn't HD).  Regarding past complaints from other reviews I can see and respect there points of view, but there was nothing that would have stopped me from purchasing and no buyers remorse after owning for about a week.  To that point there were some who thought that the unit was noisy, I would agree to the point that it does sound like a pc running and I don't think that I would want the unit sitting next to bed as I was trying to sleep, but in any family room setting the noise isn't really noticable.  To the point that the unit is too hard to figure out, read the manual (the big 170+ page manual), but after you spend some time with the unit you will find that the unit functions well and have more options than most would use, but the ones you are looking for are there. The remote seems very busy with buttons all over, although different they are well placed and will make sense after a day or so.  I've done several records and found them to be of excellent quality (both video and audio) and I do like the navigation as it allows me to choose from what's been recorded, jump to a channel, or set up a recording.  DVD playback is excellent as well.  Like I said it took me a few days to get over the learning curve, but the unit delivered as promised and I got every dollars worth that I spent.  If you are interested in purchasing, I'm not sure if strong demand, low production, or a combination of both has led to them being hard to find.  At the time I purchased, all of the electronic stores in the Milwaukee area were out and a couple of the online stores no longer had stock either.  I'm glad I purchased when I did and at this time I could not be more satisfied with my purchase."
526439,A33A51P72WEYTZ,0,1,38,B000FA1G26,11/4/2006,4,9,9,"Good value, great video quality, difficult to maneuver","I researched different DVR units with DVD recording capabilities for a long time (it was getting ridiculous), and I have been happy with this unit since I bought it a month ago.  The free TV Guide has worked well, but it did take several days to populate the schedule (not 24 hours as advertised) when first set up. Major Pros: --  Great image quality for content recorded on the SP mode (I have not tried anything else). --  DVD recording from the hard drive is easy and very fast. --  DVD playback is tolerant of minor disc scratches and disc copies (e.g. DVD Shrink back-ups) --  Ample inputs/outputs, attractive design, front display control of content and brightness. --  Ability to record onto hard drive while watching something else from the hard drive. Major Cons: --  Non-intuitive remote control with important functions poorly represented amongst a morass of infrequently used buttons. --  I fear that the flip-up lid on the remote will break if my kids ever get a hold of it (seems too fragile)."
526436,A1WTL8XLUEGTLC,0,1,35,B000FA1G26,2/25/2007,4,6,6,worth the trouble to understand the manual,"As already stated in previous reviews, the manual is hard to find information in. The instructions are pretty clear, but there isn't an index in the back or any quick way to find out what you are wanting to know. Once I find something important, I write the page number and topic on the front of the book. The DVR itself is great! I guess there is no easy way to organize all the features it has. I love the way that you can format the record speed to just about any length you want, in increments of about five minutes!"
526435,A28FMTJE5W4IUA,0,1,34,B000FA1G26,7/22/2006,4,6,6,Quite good,"The other reviews are quite accurate and helpful. I simply plugged the unit in, entered my zip code and it had all of the tv listings downloaded by the next day. The only complaint that I have and the reason why I am giving it four stars is that the menu is not very intuitive and it is fairly slow in response to user input. For example my previous dvr unit was recording all the time so that you could hit the pause button on any channel you were watching and it would freeze the show for you, this toshiba requires you to hit the time slip button and then wait for about fifteen seconds while it starts to record. The remote is also a bit ungainly but that can be solved by getting a universal remote. Overall I am very happy with it and you do get used to the quirky menus."
526434,AYO4CMLR9SZWB,0,1,33,B000FA1G26,3/20/2007,5,4,4,Well worth the money!!!!!,"First of all for those of you that don't want to buy a Tivo and pay the monthly fee. This DVR is it. It has 160gb hard drive space and has plenty of room for most that use it. I have used it to transfer my VHS tapes to DVD and works very effectively. I have recorded TV programs, movies, documentaries, educational and how to programs. It stores them onto the hard drive for viewing or transfering straight to DVD. ***One drawback is that if you have satellite like I do, the on screen programing will not work. It only works if you have cable*** It doesn't bother me though, I just use my on screen display that comes with the satellite programing. I manually time record, which is a snap, a lot easier than a VCR, etc. It will also let you do a numerous amount of things, like edit and place chapters, so you can delete commercials, place titles, too many other options to list. The Instruction booklet could have been written better, however they give you a toll free number for customer support, in which they are very good about filling in the blanks. I would highly recommend this unit and would buy another."
526433,A2NE1PK18NP3JM,0,0,32,B000FA1G26,10/27/2006,5,8,10,So good so far but the TV Guide doesn't work!!,"I did a lot of research before I bought this.  I prepared myself to read the instruction booklet first before I even took it out of the box.  I did.  It didn't take long and I had this up & running.  I did misplace the cables but I saw my mistake & it was quickly fixed. I must say that the TV Guide screen DOES NOT WORK!!!!  This doesn't trouble me because I was prepared that it wouldn't.  Thankfully, I can use this recorder manually which I do.  You can watch a program through the tuner & simply hit record to hit what you want to record.  You can also set the channel on your cable box & set the recorder to come on at a specific time.  I haven't encounter any problems with the copyright feature. Update:  I have encountered the copyright protection feature and I don't like it.  I must say I was leery of that feature but I haven't found anything yet that I can't dub-update-Oh, yes I have. I've even dubbed from my VCR to the hard drive & it works like a dream!!!! Since I set the machine with the intention of using the TV Guide screen the set up for that is not quick to say the least.  I went through that process maybe four times and it was never completed.  I hoped I'd go away like other people have & find that the information had downloaded but no such luck. This recorder says that you should position the IR Blaster in front of your cable box.  I live in a small space I have no room to do that.  I tried taping the device directly in front of the cable box but no luck.  03-22-07 A year after I have this machine I find that the TV Guide screen now comes on??? But there's no info loaded???  I haven't tried to record using it. I LOVE the bookmark feature.  I find that my recorder is set 2 minutes late so in order to record an entire program I have to record early.  No problem with having unwanted information.  I just bookmark the section I want to delete & delete it.  I also LOVE how the machine remembers at what point you stopped watching a recording.  You come back to it later & it picks up where you left off.  That's really nice! WARNING this machine does NOT play my DVD+ DVD's.  I don't have a problem with that because they do play on another machine.  I'd just think that this machine would be able to play thise considering it costs so much! There are tons of bells & whistles that I don't bother with and have no intention of bothering with like alternating the speed that I record with.  Why would I take up more space on the hard drive than I have to? I like the fact that you can see how much room you have left on the hard drive & on a DVD.  There's also the time slip feature which I have absolutely no intention of using. As long as you can read you should have no problem operating this machine.  The chapters are divided by tabs so you can quickly go to the section on ""recording"" and find what you want to find.  There's no need for an index! I love the high speed dubbing feature.  I love that I can have my info on the hard drive & move it to DVD.  This machine's fan DOES in fact run all the time.  If you're like me a TV sleeper it won't be a factor.  I fall asleep with the television on at full blast every night.  I find the fan as sort of a calming ambient noise. All in all I've recorded a TON of stuff and I'm pleased.  I have the security of knowing that I can back up my VCR tapes and I can record most of my favorite programs to watch later.  If or should I say when my machine dies I'd gladly purchase another just like it or I may even swing for a machine without that nasty copyright protection. June 28, 2007 update My DVD Recorder is having problems.  Last week I put in a blank disk and got the message ""disk not in machine"" or some such phrase.  I called the techs & they told me I can FIND someone around here to fix it or I can send it to MA.  I'm now frantically trying to find an identical machine so I can FINALIZE those 100 DVD's I have that I did not finalize.  Just last week I was thinking ""I really need to finalize"" it only took seconds so I thought I'll put it off.  I hope to GOD I can finalize those DVD's.  My advice is to finalize, finalize, finalize, finalize.  This machine worked great......until now.  I am able to still record on the hard drive so I'm thinking if I get another machine I'll be able to take the shows off the hard drive & put on another machine & burn to cd??? But what about all of those disks I didn't finalize?  I'm praying that when I get a new machine it will finalize.  I don't want to send my machine in UNTIL I at least try to get what's on there on to another machine. I'll let you know if they can fix it.  I see the message about the converter box.  I have a converter box so I guess this doesn't apply?  Guess I'll have to wait until 2009 to find out. Bottom line ALL machines will eventually break down.  Finalize your DVD's brothers and sisters.  I have a problem with recording too much I know it but I don't plan on stopping until television advances so you can basically get what you want & replay it over & over.  If certain shows were available on DVD I'd gladly buy them ""So You Think You Can Dance"" producers listen up I'm talking to you!!!!"

526431,A3FSN1HC2PJPH6,0,1,30,B000FA1G26,3/10/2007,4,3,3,TV Guide Function Not So Hot - however DVR is awesome.,"I really like the Toshiba DVR and it's many features, except the TV Guide function.  It took 24 hours to download the cable box channel line up information from each channel on my cable system and when it was done it did not display any Guide ""event"" information.  I re-read the instructions and tried two more times and still no TV Guide schedule listings.  Luckily there is a ""manual"" record setting like the old time VCR's and I can record anything I like via the ""timer"" mode.  One nice function is that it will record a show while the DVR is on and you are watching a show, unlike old VCR's where the VCR had to be powered off to use a timer recording.  My happiest moment was when I found that I could record my old 8mm home video tapes to the DVR and then burn DVD copies for the family.  Overall I like the machine and recommend it.  The cooling fan is a noticable in a silent room but not an issue during a normal day of activities or watching TV.  Set up is quick and easy.  Remote and Menu's are a bit complex at first, but if I can learn it, anyone can.  I've only scratched the surface of the available options and features of this Toshiba DVR and so far it hasn't disappointed."
526430,AIKP8E0QTP0K9,0,0,29,B000FA1G26,2/8/2007,5,3,3,Thrilled with Toshiba DVD Player/Recorder with HDD,"The Toshiba RD-XS35 is easy to install and configure.  The Quickstart guide is easy to follow and it is pretty comprehensive.  The main manual is not as clear, though.  One interesting item was that the location of the 'Delete' button was hard to determine.  The remote control bottom section with numbers flips down to expose a second layer of buttons where the 'Delete' button is located.  The bottom part of the remote is kind of like a Star Trek communicator where you can flip the bottom part of the remote down to access additional features.  This was not obvious from the Guide. TV Guide Online works great for us.  Installation was a little confusing because they offered two rebuilds for our cable company so we chose the one with the higher number.  This seemed to work since the channels are configured correctly and the timing has been good.  One point of clarification is that you can set recording modes to ""Regularly"" or ""Weekly"".  ""Weekly"" records the show every week at the same time and ""Regularly"" will record all shows that come in during the week every week.  So, if you set ""Law and Order"" to record regularly, your recorder is going to pick up a lot of programming. The fan is noisy but I found it easy to accept it as white noise and it does not bother me.  But, I can easily understand if someone would get annoyed with it because the fan is pretty much always on.  To me, it sounds similar to a small humidifier. The navigation of recorded shows is great.  You click on a button on the remote and you get a panel with pictures of all recorded shows (first frame of the recording, I presume).  Each show is listed with title and recording time. We could not be happier with this device."

It worked right out of the box, and continues to work well.  I give DVRs in general five stars, and don't plan to ever be without one again.  Being able to have my favorite shows automatically recorded, and skip the commercials (30 seconds at a time, as well as search the online schedule for the other movies has been a joy.  I rarely watch anything that is not recorded partly because of the comercial skip, and partly since I don't usually get to set down to watch an entire show without inturption. Upsides-(1) I get ~100 hrs at LP (I am not to picky about the video quality) (2) Very fast burn to DVD.  Less than 2 minutes to set it up to record once you have the hang of it, and burns 4 hours at LP in ~5 minutes.  (3) Did I mention comercial skip. Downsides (1) Not a very friendly/intuitive interface, takes a while to get to where you can use it well. (2) Has dropped the schedule from memory a couple of times, and sometimes takes a full day to reload it, and has had a couple of blips where it does not respond as it should, but has always recovered by itself."

I've had a few times where it has shut down because it was recording and i was watching something timeslipped, and basically it just got confused...  but I just turned it off and back on and it worked fine.  I love this device...  My wife who is ""not very good with electronics"" is able to work it 95% of the time.  Plus...  being able to edit my saved programs and burn them to DVD-R or DVD-RW has been great...

It has the TV Guide  feature on it, which makes recording tv shows very simple.  I have an older Toshiba DVD Player/Recorder that uses the VCR+ system to record shows, which never worked quire right (you basically had to program it like an old VCR).  So, I'm very pleased with the ease of use of this machine. The only drawback I've found on this DVD Player/Recorder is the fan, as noted by other reviewers.  I bought this one to use in the bedroom, but after the first night, had to move it to the living room.  The fan was SO loud, that there was no sleeping in the same room with it.  I'm used to other machines that are a little loud when they're on and in use, but this one is constantly loud, even when it's off.  As long as you're not buying this unit for use in the bedroom, then you should get it, becuase other than the noise, it's a great product."
526425,A3JCD36GMODWAT,0,0,24,B000FA1G26,3/8/2007,5,1,1,Excellent product,"I purchased this unit about 2 months ago and have been very happy with it. I have not experienced any of the issues reported in other reviews. I think the issue with the TV Guide has to do more with your local cable company than the unit. Mine downloaded a full week's worth of programming in less than two days, and operating the guide is trouble-free. Reports of the Guide being slow had me worrying that each button press would take 10-15 seconds to respond. But it turns out that it is about the same half-second lag time that's common with any satellite receiver. On the issue of fan noise: I can't hear anything unless I put my ear within inches of the unit. Some people must have really good hearing. As for the functionality of the unit, iself, I have been able to do everything I wanted in a DVD recorder with a HD. I have shows set up to record each week on the HD; I can high speed dub these shows to DVD; I have recorded taped shows onto the HD, edited out the commercials, and then dubbed the show onto a DVD. The only flaw I have found is that when a timed program is about to begin, it brings up a message saying so that you have to click out of, and then a minute, it brings up a dialogue box asking if you want to change the channel or abort the recording. This in itself isn't so bad if it only did it when you were watching TV. I would say it would be even necessary. But here's the problem: it also does this when you're watching a DVD. It should not interrupt you when you're in the middle of movie to verify a timer recording; it should do it silently in the background. But even with this small complaint, I still gave the unit 5 stars, since 4.5 isn't an option."

And it did sorta work, for a while.  Until I got a cable box.  Then I spent many hours trying to make it work.  I used the IR blaster.  I turned it off for 24 hours to let it go through all the channels.  I repeated this process. I beat my head against my TV screen.  To no avail. If this was the only problem, it would still be a four star product.  I realize this problem is mainly with TVGOS, not Toshiba.  However, the primary problem with the unit is the green tint it imparts onto recorded programs.  Apparently, I had gotten used to this (as have probably all the other reviewers), until others started pointing it out to me.  Now it's obvious.  I've researched this, and apparently it's a ""hardware problem.""  As in, can't be fixed because it occurs on ALL of these units. My advice would be, as much as I hate to say it, rent the DVR box from your cable company.  Not that this is a good option, but at least you can get rid of it without losing too much money when the technology finally catches up to where these things work well."

There is one important fact about the feature, it's free!  I have no experience with Tivo or Direct TV or any other monthly service, my cable cost $20 a month and I wasn't looking forward to doubling that for a one year subsciption of Tivo.  As far as the complications of operatring the machine, I haven't had a problem trying to figure out some of the programming features, but I haven't gotten to all the features yet.  When deciding on buying a unit, crunch the numbers and decide for yourself what you want to do, lock into a contract or deal with imperfections."

I was promised a call from their technicians specializing in this service last Fridays and I waited all day with no contact.

Got another cablebox, same thing! Got another cablebox, used my old Philips, no problem! And I could not get it to automatically record anything!

Able to record over a weekend unlimited abouts of TV without wondering if the tape will run out.

That died and when I tried to bring it back up it was frozen in mid path. So I leave it hidden. The counter on the front display still works. Since the bar died, so did the channel display. I select a channel and it use to display what I typed in. Now I select the channel and wait 20-30sec to see if it changes to what I selected. Yes it's slow to change channels if you type in the numbers. If you use the arrow up or down to change channels. That's normal speed. After 2009 it's not going to matter anyway.

The DVR part still works fine on the XS-32.  I was able to burn approximately 3 disks on the XS-32 before the writer died.  The dvd worked for another 3 years as just a player.  Then it died after our fourth call and an update disk from Toshiba.  Or first call was under warranty, but it wasn't documented by the customer service tech who recommended that a simple ""reset"" to the unit by unplugging it would fix it.  Our second call was documented but their answer was the same as the first, and reminded us that the unit was no longer under warranty..  The third call mysteriously found an update disk.. which killed the remaining fuctionality of the dvd as a player.. and the fourth call was when our 54 unit died and they basically said tough crap... The XS-54 unit died after its first attempt to record anything.  The XS-54 has a TV GUIDE glitch that it has had since new and Toshiba offered an update disk.. too bad that this unit no longer accepts ANY disk.  It just says disk is dirty or damaged.  Thanks Toshiba.. and how would you like us to install this update..   So in addition to having the 32 unit which works fine as a DVR, we also have this 54 unit which we can no longer rely on it recording what we ask it to because of a known glitch since new that we can't update because of a bad DVD drive..  GREAT!!! Unfortunately we didn't try to burn enough DVD's while still under warranty so we could have figured these products were crap while still under the 1 year warranty.  I still kick myself for not buying the Philips unit, or sticking with the Panasonic we had initally tried. Oh, and the kicker...  I called the only outlet for Toshiba electronic parts and was quoted almost $600 dollars to just buy the replacement DVD recorder drive inside the unit..  LOL..  I asked if I had contacted a money laundering operation, or an electronic parts supplier. So basically I'm out over $800 bucks on Toshiba products.  Never again."
526407,A195SR83K9B9HK,0,1,6,B000FA1G26,6/23/2007,2,1,2,Wouldn't buy another one.,I had many difficulties with this product. It has impeccable playback on the DVD and DVR/HDD side.  I planned on using it to replace my TIVO and I found that the TV Guide online programming was extremely unreliable and quirky.  The most annoying thing was that I couldn't scroll through this listings without the darn thing trying to change the channel.  I could not find a setting to correct this.  I am someone who rarely uses the instruction book and I found myself consulting the instructions on a weekly basis.  This thing is just too darn difficult to use at least compared to TIVO. The clarity of the picture versus my TIVO Series 2 is much better so I guess I would consider that a pro.  However it is a pain in the butt for regular TV watching.

In the past I used a video cassette recorder for this purpose.  However, I decided the try the Toshiba unit because the price has come down close to $300 for a DVR, and I could not be more pleased.  I do find the built in program menu tedious to use (slow to get to programs even a few hours away), and the manual programming also requires quite a few actions, but the functionality is very helpful.  I can record several days of programs without worrying about running out of space.  I can watch the local news (recorded previously) while the network news is recording, or even timeslip to watch the network news as it is still recording.  I have not used the DVD writing functions, but they offer some pretty powerful editing tools.  I did find a minor bug in the software that caused a problem when I was watching one recording in timeslip mode when it came time for that recording to end and start recording another channel, but it did preserve both recordings for me.  In short, there is a lot of functionality for the price.  I never knew what I was missing in not having this kind of DVR functionality. If you are a bit patient with the programming, this unit will provide the functionality one had to pay well over $500 for not so long ago."

Other revewiers describe it as a fan noise, which it may well be, but it sort of sounds like the refrigerator when the compressor kicks on, only not quite as loud.  It makes the sound even when the unit is turned off (as long as it is plugged in).  It might not be so bad if it only made the noise when it was in use, because the TV sound mostly masks it at moderate volume.  But it is still very audible when watching TV at low volume or when flipping between channels.  Most importantly, when the TV is off, it is terribly annoying.  We decided after less than an hour to box the unit up and return it.  If you like to read or sleep or relax in the same room as your TV, this unit is probably not for you."

I knew what I wanted - a corded handset, nothing too expensive, that worked out of the box. I also wanted - and this was the tricky part - to find one that would also work on my Mac and not just the PC. When checking around for products I was amazed at how expensive some of this stuff was. Equally there was some very cheap stuff out there but I had no idea if it would work. Fortunately I stumbled across the IPEVO FREE1 phone and various reviews that said it worked on Mac OSX (if you download the drivers) so I ordered it. Straight away I have to say that this whole buying experience was excellent - Amazon are usually very good for me but this time they excelled; my phone arrived less than 36 hours after I had ordered it and even with Free Super Saver Delivery. It cost me ?17.99 which is one heck of a bargain. When it arrived I plugged it into the USB port on my Mac and it worked as a phone instantly. However pressing all the little buttons on it did nothing so I went to the IPEVO website and downloaded the drivers, realised that I have to run a little separate program as well as Skype, ran the program and off it went. I had a choice of ringtones on the handset (all pretty basic), where the sound came from (I could have it from the computer's speakers or the Free1 handset), how loud various bits `n bobs were. Basically all the things you might need to change. It's got some useful buttons on it that scroll down your Skype contacts list so you don't actually have to touch the computer to make calls and stuff. I then loaded the drivers for the PC, plugged it into the PC and it worked instantly then too (although I did have to shut down first, as it informed me). I can't think of the last time I plugged the same new piece of hardware into both PC and Mac and it worked first time, so 10 points for IPEVO for that. Sound quality seems fine on both platforms, there's a little green light so you know it's working and... what more can I say. A great bit of kit, a smaller handset than your usual home phone (it's 15cm long and just under 4cm wide) and it works. It's a great little phone that I highly recommend."

We both got tired of stretching our necks to talk to each other. Plus, I'm always in an internet cafe or at Starbucks, so I don't feel like sharing the last details of my life with a bunch of strangers ordering their lattes. I ran across the New York Times review of this little beauty and thought I found the perfect solution. So, no, it doesn't do the dishes, but if both parties have a fast connection and Skype, the quality of voice beats regular phones hands down. The design is also really attractive, and reliable. I've been carrying it in my briefcase, and it's easy to store. Minus: I'd love for it to have a record button, those are always useful. I think the other model of it, Free2, has it, but I'm not sure. My mom has been using it with the POV webcam they make too, and I think the first time she put it in, the webcam microphone got set as a default microphone instead of this usb phone.

526396,ADMWYMH11LD27,0,1,6,B000FBDZIS,5/7/2006,3,16,17,"Sturdy bag, but large and doesn't hold much...","I recently purchased a MacBook Pro 15.4 inch model, and of course, I wanted to protect my new baby. There are literally hundreds of bags to choose from, but the reviews on this bag at the Apple Store website were inspiring, as was the design, and the testimonals on the Brenthaven site itself. Now the bag itself *IS* a nice bag. It's certainly sturdy, there's no questioning that, and I feel extremely confident that my MacBook will survive in there unscathed. The problem is, the bag is big, and yet it doesn't hold very much, at least by my standards. The ""CORE"" protection system inside takes up a lot of room, and of course, the MacBook itself, while thin, is big, because of the beautiful widescreen display on it. The bag itself weights about three pounds, the MacBook another five and a half, plus then the charger, so you're talking about nine pounds right off the bat to be carrying all the time. The bag I had before this, a Jansports green ""messenger brief"" which I could sling over my shoulder, or carry like a briefcase, just like this, was, and still is a great bag. It held a lot of things, and I would pack it thusly. I can't do that with this Brenthaven bag. If I have my MacBook in this bag, I can fit, say, two half liter bottles of water, the MacBook charger, my cell phone charger, and two 120-page spiral notebooks for class. And it's an uncomfortable fit then, and the bag is very bulky then. I can't fit my copy of The Times in there either anymore, with said items. With my Jansport bag, I would usually carry around notebooks for school, two bottles of water, The Times, random food items for the day to save money (can of soup, pouch of microwave rice, things in a Pyrex glass container so they wouldn't get crushed), along with other odd ends. I can't do this anymore. So, again, while the Brenthaven bag is nice, don't expect to carry much in it other than the MacBook itself, and a notebook or two, espcially if you use the mesh holdings inside to store things like bottles of water. The back of the bag has a pouch to store stuff in, but don't expect to put much in it because to close it (via velcro), it can't be bulging out much. Also, items in this pouch, if not flat, will beat against your leg if slung across your shoulder. There's also a front zipper pouch which doesn't hold much, and is annoying to use. I'm probably going to return this, and purchase the ""Brenthaven Metro,"" which is really just to hold the MacBook itself only, and nothing else. Then I'll just have to carry around two bags each day, probably just carrying the MacBook around like a suitcase."

I just bought the new MacBook Pro 15.4 and wanted to make sure my $2500 investment would be around for a while.  This bag has ample protection for my computer and, on days when I don't want to carry my computer, the sleeves pulls out leaving lots of room for my gym clothes and books.  The water bottle pocket and expandable zipper are great little extras as well.  If you're looking for great protection and style in a messenger bag, look no further."

It's rugged and has a fair amount of room for the usual suspects of extras the MacBook Pro ships with out of the box(AC adapter, power cable, DVI to VGA, even a snug pouch for the Apple Remote) and still affords space for my cable lock (yes, I'm paranoid), iPod, and whatever 1.5 - 2.o inch thick software development book I'm reading at the moment (two books if I fit them snug).  As of this writing I'm on a business trip to Singapore and it's with me almost all the time.  The shoulder strap makes it pretty easy to carry with little or no slipping, the front clasps are easy for security screening at the airport, and the velcro back pocket is great for quick access to important things safely between you and your MacBook (e.g. your boarding pass or a map of that foreign city you just landed in). I'll warn up front, that I may be a bit biased.  The only other laptop bag I've owned was for my 12"" iBook and it too was a Brenthaven.  The bags may be priced a bit more, but when it comes to keeping your portable Mac safe they are worth it. To me in terms of durability, protection, and quality of construction, anything cheaper is just that: cheap!"
526393,A1Q8JCUD3QT0M9,0,0,3,B000FBDZIS,7/4/2007,4,1,1,This model is now discontinued,"Since writing the review below I've discovered that Brenthaven has discontinued the Fusion and from what I can see their online catalog shows models which are designed without the dangling straps I was critical of in the review.  I believe it would be best to buy a new model rather than this discontinued one, but for those interested in the Fusion you might find this review useful: May 2007 trip notes: The Brenthaven bag offers not only outstanding performance but also a very good value.  I've been traveling with it now for 26 days in Asia and it's accompanied me pretty much everywhere.  I bought it from Apple directly when I purchased a new MacBook.  I've used Macs and PCs for years but almost exclusively desktop machines, so I'm not an experienced laptop carrying case reviewer; in fact this is only the second one I've owned (the first being a cumbersome Targus, issued years ago by my former employer, also with a Mac laptop). I like the Brenthaven design for various reasons.  It offers great protection for the computer, with spring-type pads on the sides and a nice velcro system on the top that keeps it in.  The top flap is light and no-nonsense which I like, with a clean, thin, tight pocket in front.  Inside the bag there is another zippered compartment.  There is a very well-designed set of neat pockets outside of that compartment.  It has a horizontal see-though pocket I found the perfect place for a flash memory drive, a cell-phone pocket, lots of thoughtful spots for pens (I'm a pen-freak and always travel with several favorites, so it's nice to know they're well-placed), and a few other little nooks and cranny spots for little things you might travel with.  There is also a separate compartment, in front of where the computer is situated, for some files.  I always had about 30 pieces of paper with me in a manila folder in that spot.  Also in the same area is a set of two pockets of net material, where I kept my Levenger mini note pad in one, and my Nikon S7 (a nice thin camera) in the other.  In terms of functionality, this bag has it all. I have the black one (not sure if they offer other colors).  The material is lightweight and strong, the seams are well-sewn, and I would expect to pay more for this bag so Kudos to Brenthaven for getting such a fine product to market for a great price. In terms of criticism, I have a few comments also. To be fair, the bag gives great protection to the laptop, but it just feels a little bit too big.  If there is a way to perhaps cut the length an inch or so that would be great. The top flap has female buckles connecting to thin straps with male buckles which are not sufficiently connected to the straps.  So you are constantly tightening down the straps after you buckle it.  I'd like to set the straps to one spot and not have to fiddle with them every time you open or close the flap.  The straps are also at least a few inches too long, so they dangle down.  There are rubber grommet-type things on the end of the straps which adds weight so you're always dangling where ever you go.  For a high school cheerleader, having a dangling accessory might be cute but I found it undesirable.  So I would re-work the straps if I were Brenthaven.  Figure out a way to keep the buckles in one position, and hide the dangle.  Call it a Hide the Dangle intra-company challenge. The other thing is the logo of this company.  For such a fine bag, they sure have a silly, unimaginative logo.  Perhaps that's part of the schtick they want to portray, but I don't care for it.  Baby blue little upside down Vs. It's not really anything you associate with strength (this bag is a tough protector) and it does not remind you of anything related to technology.  If it were up to me, I would do some brainstorming and come up with a more suitable logo.  Apples, computers, strong bag, clever design: why upside down baby blue Vs?  Perhaps the logo should be a little ignition switch like you find in a modern jet plane, or go with the Al Gore hype & make it a sentry, efficient lightbulb.  Who knows, just putting out some things that come to mind. Another point of criticism is that the bag does not have a place to keep business cards.  I am really not sure if business cards are going the way of the buggy whip in USA, because my company deals mainly with overseas contacts where the paper business card is very much alive and well.  Please figure out a clever place to store business cards, preferably near the pen slots on the inside of the flap.  Several of the existing nooks and crannies near the existing pen slots are redundant and not useful anyway. At any rate, dangling straps and goofy logo notwithstanding, this is a great bag you will not regret purchasing."

I love the fact that on the front it has a normal iPod dock *and* it also has a USB port for the shuffle. I've used both my shuffle and 4th Gen 20GB iPod in it with no problems. With the shuffle you can't control it from the unit, you have to use the buttons on the shuffle, but the music plays fine and it appears to recharge it. Nothing to complain about with the sound quality. It gets plenty loud for my small apartment, quality seems good and base is good. I'm not an audiophile by any measure, but it is good enough for me. The remote is a bit large and has too many buttons. It is an IR remote, not an RF remote, but it works fine. CD player and radio work fine. I really appreciate the fact that you can turn off the blue lights on the front! I haven't tried the alarm functions. NOTE: I didn't end up getting this at amazon.

Just seems to sound the best that way.  It's a sleek unit.  I wish, however, that it had a carry/handle to make it a portable unit.  I like that it has a remote control.  Not knowing - believe it or not - what generation iPod I own I got very nervous when I read that if you have a fifth generation unit you have to supply the docking thingy that came with your unit.  And I thought, like who would keep such a thing?  Luckily for me, my unit is apparently older so they provided the plastic sleeve I needed.  I don't think I saw any mention of this ""little"" detail in the ads that I read.  SO....fifth generation owners...make sure you have the docking insert on hand if you intend to buy this unit."

If you just want a speaker for your iPod this may not be what you are looking for, but if you want to basically replace your stereo system with one that has iPod capability I would recommend this system.

It's not included (so you better keep the original ipod box with its adaptor). Although, the 4G adapter works (not recommended in the long shot). The only downside is that the control don't navigate the entire ipod system. Just works for play/pause and to go forward and backwards between tracks. So you have to make some cool playlists."

I liked the radio performance of an under the counter Emerson unit at a Target store, but we needed a shelf model.  The reviews on this unit were mostly good and the size and appearance were good, so I bought it.  The iPod playback is neat (worth one star) and I suppose the CD player is good, but the radio is not usable - the reception is terrible.  Stations that come in well on two other small radios in our house either don't come in at all or are very noisy.  There is a little wire for an FM antenna and no way to improve the reception of AM or FM with a better antenna.  Also, the two bright strips of blue ""neon"" light on the sides of the unit are distracting and unnecessary.  I took it back for a refund."

I loved waking up to my ipod, since it would start out really quiet and slowly get louder, not jarring me out of bed like most alarms. The display is not good for an actual clock though, because it's tiny and you can only see it with the blue light on which is too bright when you're trying to sleep. I thought the sound quality was pretty good for such a small machine and I used to crank it up pretty loud. The radio reception is horrible. The CD player doesn't have a shuffle option that I could find, but that wasn't too big of a deal, I bought it mostly for my ipod. In less than a year, the connector jack for the ipod stopped transmitting sound. It recognizes the ipod but there is no sound unless you jiggle the ipod while it's on the dock. Even then, it will sort of work, but as soon as you let go, the sound goes away again. I even took the thing apart in case something came loose inside. To no avail. I can listen to the ipod if I connect it with an aux cable, but then I don't get to use the alarm clock or the remote to control the ipod, which are two of the options I loved about this player. So it's great, if it works. I don't think I'll buy another one. It's too expensive to be so breakable."

I have a COMPAQ Presario 2700 and the Bluetooth adapter could not connect physically with the USB port. Then I tried it with my COMPAQ Evo N600c as that Laptop has a USB port on the left side so the Bluetooth adapter could connect. The printed user guide is translated in many languages but useless to all readers as it describes only how to setup and install the drivers which most of us know anyway. The features of the phone are not described in the printed user manual. I copied the driver and bluetooth adapter utility from the CD but it did not connect with the handset. After uninstalling it re-installing same problem. Then I called up the TRENDNET 24/7 customer service where a representative took my Phone number and Name and model number of the hardware and said that someone would call on Monday (I called them on saturday). I was very certain that if I could not get this device to work in another one hour I would surely send it back first thing Monday morning. I downloaded the driver from the TRENDNET website and decided to give it another shot. This time it worked. The handset is very basic with 4 ringtones and no way to add more. Can't do anything with the display either. It does not have a phonebook or any other utilites which one would except from a phone. Like one touch dialling, Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch, Auto Answer etc. When using Skypeout I can't disconnect the phone by pressing the red disconnect button on the handset, I have to open the skype application and the disconnect it. So one needs to be near the computer to do this. On the whole a dissapointment not worth the price. Niloufer Tamboly, CISSP"

However, the glossy Quick Installation printed guide and the shoddy .pdf user's guide on CD are not user-friendly; they are not only confusing but also do not provide all the information one needs to install and operate the phone with ease. For instance, unlike most electronics products that include a printed picture of the product with captions of buttons and function icons so that you can understand what you are doing, here one needs first to print on his own the .pdf User's Guide in order to find out what the phone buttons and icons mean and complete the installation, let alone use the phone."

I have a COMPAQ Presario 2700 and the Bluetooth adapter could not connect physically with the USB port. Then I tried it with my COMPAQ Evo N600c as that Laptop has a USB port on the left side so the Bluetooth adapter could connect. The printed user guide is translated in many languages but useless to all readers as it describes only how to setup and install the drivers which most of us know anyway. The features of the phone are not described in the printed user manual. I copied the driver and bluetooth adapter utility from the CD but it did not connect with the handset. After uninstalling it re-installing same problem. Then I called up the TRENDNET 24/7 customer service where a representative took my Phone number and Name and model number of the hardware and said that someone would call on Monday (I called them on saturday). I was very certain that if I could not get this device to work in another one hour I would surely send it back first thing Monday morning. I downloaded the driver from the TRENDNET website and decided to give it another shot. This time it worked. The handset is very basic with 4 ringtones and no way to add more. Can't do anything with the display either. It does not have a phonebook or any other utilites which one would except from a phone. Like one touch dialling, Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch, Auto Answer etc. When using Skypeout I can't disconnect the phone by pressing the red disconnect button on the handset, I have to open the skype application and the disconnect it. So one needs to be near the computer to do this. On the whole a dissapointment not worth the price. Niloufer Tamboly, CISSP"

But the phone works great with Skype once it's setup properly.  The range is incredible!  I have a three story house and my computer is all the way upstairs jammed in the far corner of the house.  The signal is excellent all the way down to the bottom level of my home, and to the other end.  I may save some a little confusion by letting you know that the phone takes over as your pc speaker while the phone is in use.  So if you end a call, and then sign onto AOL or start playing a song, the audio plays in the phone, and not on the PC speakers.  I finally figured out that the phone goes into ""sleep"" mode 3 minutes after you stop using it, and the audio is restored to the PC speakers.  For those who want to fidget with the audio settings, there are settings in both Windows XP as well as the Skype settings.  I just left my settings ""as is"".  Seems to get the job done!  I also might mention that I have Linksys Wireless SRX Router downstairs in my office.  When I'm very close to the router, it does cause a little static/hiss with the phone reception.  But otherwise, the phone reception is CRYSTAL CLEAR!  I give it two thumbs up !!"

The voice quality is clear, the range is fantastic for a bluetooth device, it syncs pretty well with Skype, and it's relatively easy to use.  The only complaints that I have for the phone are as follows: 1) The phone sometimes requires more than one attempt to sync up with Skype when you first turn it on, and 2) Whenever you turn the phone on, the device automatically becomes your default audio device for the computer, which means that you'll hear all the rest of you computer's sounds when you are in the middle of your conversation, and in order to change the default audio device back to your regular speakers, you frequently have to do so manually, or wait for the phone to go into sleep mode after a few minutes of inactivity."

However, the glossy Quick Installation printed guide and the shoddy .pdf user's guide on CD are not user-friendly; they are not only confusing but also do not provide all the information one needs to install and operate the phone with ease. For instance, unlike most electronics products that include a printed picture of the product with captions of buttons and function icons so that you can understand what you are doing, here one needs first to print on his own the .pdf User's Guide in order to find out what the phone buttons and icons mean and complete the installation, let alone use the phone."

A handful of times last summer, with the fan set at the highest setting in the hottest weather, I started to get chilly. 95 degree dry Colorado heat and I was getting a little cold with this fan.

When you get yours home, I suggest that you quickly change the color settings on the LCD.  The default is 50% across the board.  But most people I know prefer 9300K... which is a far cry from that.

I could not separate the 2 lightest stripes with any combination of Brightness and Contrast --  meaning that a shade lighter than 5% gray will appear the same as white.

It has the most human-like playing style of any engine I am familiar with and it's play is very strong.  As other people mention below, there are perhaps more strong engines, but if you are not competing in tournaments where chess engines compete against other chess engines or you are not interested in ""centaur"" or computer assisted chess, you may not need to go with the strongest engine unless you are Gary Kasparov.  On the other hand, the different programming and playing styles are interesting to compare and contrast for very strong players.  These folks probably buy ALL of the top three engines anyway, so I need to say any more about that! I also own DEEP FRITZ GRAND MASTER DELUXE.  This is also an excellent chess engine, but it is currently half the cost of this one!  If you are looking for economy, this might be the way to go because it's playing strength is comparable and certainly adequate for even a very highly rated player.  However, it's playing style is not as human or natural.  If you are buying a first chess engine, however, I think you will be thrilled. Both of the engines above include one year of free membership to http://m-w.com/which is a lot of fun!  Here you can play many players from around the world 24 hours a day.  You can also save, download and analyze these games in either of these two fine chess engines. Considering the technology, sophistication and hours of fun you can have with either of the two chess engines I mentioned, but are a real bargain.  However, if you are on a budget, I might pick up Deep Fritz Grand Master Deluxe and then wait for the new version of Hiarcs to come out and see how it compares to the new versions of other engines.  If you don't feel like Deep Fritz is enough, you will have something brand new to play with and you can check out the reviews with a good base knowledge of the limitation of another fine product.  If cost is not an issue, I prefer HIARCS 10 to Deep Fritz. Lastly, while I'm a decent chess player, I am not in the championship class and I don't do a lot of deep book analysis at high speeds.  If you are in this category then it may make sense for you to go with HIARCS or one of the other top-rated engines.  There is some detail on this in other reviews, so I will not repeat it here. If you have comments about my review or suggestions of other information to include, I would sure appreciate you leaving them.  I will read them and update my review based on additional feedback.  I would especially like to know if anyone feels that I steered them wrong.  I've played a lot with both engines and I feel confident I can make these suggestions from an informed stance."

Those are the top 3 names and every year the different developers try and upgrade with +30 or so rating on the top chess engine when they do battle at the various chess engine tournaments. As it stands at this time of writing Shredder 10 is trying to pip Hiarcs 10. Rybka currently tops both Hiarcs 10 and Shredder 9. Toga II and Fruit can also compete well (sometimes scoring higher). The problem is that Rybka, Toga II and Fruit are engines. Hiarcs 10 and Shredder 10 are engines but are both packaged with chessbase software which costs $30 for the latest edition. So for $20 extra you are getting the engines and the chess software. If you want the top of the line chess engine then Rybka is probably where you want to go if you are willing to shell out an experimental $70 for it. Shredder 10 is being tested at the moment so right now the #2 place goes to this engine, Hiarcs 10. You are going to get one of the most powerful chess engines in the world if you purchase this. At #2 it can only drop 3 places if the other 3 engines can beat it. Hiarcs 10 is also the same price as Shredder 10. Dont go here though if you are just trying to improve your game. Something like Deep Fritz 8 can be bought now for $20 if you get the ""Deep Fritz: Grand Master Deluxe"" software package. That has the Deep Fritz 8 chess software package that can load up all the top engines if you have them. Fritz 9 is more expensive with an updated chess software package and can load the new engines too. You don't really need to spend all this much to have a good engine (the $20 set above is beyond 99% of us) but at the same time if you can get Hiarcs 10 then use it because it is powerful."
