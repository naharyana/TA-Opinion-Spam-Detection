"We recently got DirecTV after seeing their ad blitz for 75 HD channels.  They brag about their ""digital picture and sound,"" and their great customer service. The truth is the only way to get digital picture and sound is with a HDTV and an HDMI.  Their picture is actually worse than the picture we got with Comcast.  Not to mention there is no two year agreement with cable, no picture loss when it rains, you do not have to pay for ""leased equipment, and you do not need an ugly dish hanging on your house. When we purchased our most recent HDTV, we figured we would replace the DVR we had with DirecTV and get an HD DVR to replace it. DirecTV told us we would have to pay $299 for the privlige of leasing their receiver from them.  In addition to this we would have to pay $50 because we were a new customer ""and had not established a credit history with them.""  Also, we would have to pay $20 for shipping and handling and extend our contract for another two years.

"If you're reading this.  You are thinking about dropping some serious cash so I will try and help you out! If you're trying to decide between this, which is Adobe production studio premium or the Standard Edition do not buy  The Standard Edition, you get so much more with this version, I repeat do not buy the Standard Edition. You're probably interested in getting the Adobe production studio premium edition.  I have to tell you, this is a great product, the dynamic link is such an amazing feature a links together.  Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe encore, seamlessly.  You can take Adobe After Effects compositions into premiere Pro without rendering.  Then if you need to edit the composition you just pop back into after effects, tweak it adjust it pop back into premiere and is automatically updated.  It is just an amazing thing to see it in action. After effects has got a total facelift, along with encore audition and premiere Pro.  Gone is the ""palette-tosis"" of the old programs.  Where you would lose palettes have palettes on top of palettes not know where to find a palette.  The new facelift is totally awesome. Stability: I've been using these programs for few days, and they are totally stable.  One crash, I think I had and I think was my fault.  Adobe encore, I feel is the best improvements from the old version making a DVD with the new flowchart is so amazingly simple. Adobe After Effects 7.0 after effects is the bomb is you such an amazing program.  Once you get past the user interface and learn some of the nuances you can do almost anything and mean anything with video is awesome.  7.0 has the ton of user presets.  The text effects are great.  The backgrounds that you can create that come as presets, all editable.  A cool thing is with a new user presets, you can see them actually preview and Adobe Bridge.  This is cool! Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 this program now is more in line with user interface from premiere elements.  The one thing I really enjoy now about from your Pro 2.0.  Is that I can import MPEG files from my replay TV and edit them.  This is something that was sorely lacking in from your Pro 1.5 user interfaces been revamped in the new style.  He just feels a lot cleaner smoother and more stable. Adobe audition 2.0 this program, I think has gotten the most drastic user interface upgrade.  I'm not really in the audio is what don't really know what under the hood is changed.  I do know it's got ASIO drivers now.  That is a big deal if you're an audio.  But now the user interface is more in line with all the other a video products.  Was nice about audition now is that if you have a audiophile in premiere Pro 2.0.  You can now send it to audition, change it or modify it save it and it brings it back right into premiere.  No reimporting, that is so cool. Adobe encore 2.0 if you're wondering about Adobe encore this upgrade is nice.  The automatic slideshow creator, while only limited to 99 photos per slideshow is a nice feature.  I'd use it already.  There are some limitations in the slideshow creator like again, only 99 photos per slideshow but you could link unlimited slideshows back to back to back, but you're still limited to 99.  In each slideshow.  Stability I feel in this program is vastly improved the old encore.  I was so like I was teetering on the edge of losing my whole project.  I feel of it safer and encore 2.0.  It has a ton more templates is integration with Adobe Photoshop and with Adobe After effects is amazing.  You will love it! Adobe Bridge 1.0 this program is quirky.  It crashed about 20 times.  It has the potential to be really great, but it's good takes a more time to get there.  Building of this program as your media manager.  Again, it's not there yet.  I'm still using Adobe Photoshop elements, the tagging portion to organize my digital photographs. Adobe dynamic link this program really isn't a program, but it is a program.  If you know and mean?  Basically dynamic link links together all of the applications in the production studio.  Now the hitch is you can't get this if you buy the program separately.  So to see it in action, you have to buy the production studio.  Another reason why you should invest.  But once you have it up and running.  You will be amazed.  It simplifies workflow drastically one place all this in action I bought it enough said. So there you have it my micromini review of Adobe production studio premium.  Something to keep in mind, this does come with a disk of totaltraining that reviews each of the programs give you some of the new features it about two hours.  Not really great but it's free.  When you install it the first time.  You wanna register online seeing a free plug-in are a couple templates that they offer you if you miss this opportunity the first time you install it.  You will not get another chance I believe, so make sure you register. This install comes on five DVDs income of five gigs of loops for Adobe audition, a bunch of DVD templates, and other goodies. Another thing to note, you will not be old to upgrade individual programs.  Once you buy the production studio.  So this means that if a new version of Photoshop CS3 comes out.  You will have to wait to upgrade the production studio.  You can't upgrade individual products.  This kind of rots but I guess you gotta deal. This does have online activation That's all I can think of at the moment, if I think of anything more.  I'll update this review.  Go to Adobe's web site and download the program demos.  The one thing you won't get is dynamic link so you'll have to use your imagination and see how it will fit in.  Also check out the creative cow (dot) com. With the production studio, you also get Adobe Photoshop CS2 in Adobe Illustrator CS2.  That is a huge bonus.

"After reading many reviews of the fm transmittion criteria, I found myself in the market for one. The best reviews that I could find where the Monster IcarPlay (newer) and the Kensington 33185, I could not find either specific model anywhere near me, so I went down to the local bestbuy and got myself the Griffin RoadTrip. I was quite skeptical to see how this would perform because I read many negative reviews regarding Griffin products. After purchasing it for $118 CAD (about $105 US), I went in the car and tried it out. the set up is quite basic and after a few minutes I was listening to my nano with decent sound quality (same as local radio stations). I live in the biggest suburbia in North America, Mississauga, Ontario and the transmittion is quite good. Pros: It does not skip, even as the ipod wiggles from the road bumps It stays in tact Easy to use Good sound quality Comes with everything you need, every ipod model capability Can be used with your PC or Mac to transmit sound for you home stereo Convinient comes with Doc+holder+clip (s) Cons Constant access to the ipod battery could mean that the battery's life is ending faster than it should. the sound quality isn't top notch. (after all it is a transmitter, very minor complaint) Ipod users limit your sounds to minimum when the ipod is playing because it will not have an effect on the transmittion at all. This is probabbly a good thing. Over all I'd like to give it a 5, but 4 seemes more appropriate, due to price and capability. As far as fm transmittion goes this product will not dissapoint you.",5/29/2006,9.0,9.0,A10BM6VYPTXRTN,B000BMXJR8,4.0,0.0,541497.0,270.0,Great product as far as fm transmittion goes...,0.0,1,0,Griffin Technology,89.99,Griffin Technology 4031-RDGC RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger and Cradle for iPod (Charcoal),Brand->Griffin Technology,BatteriesIncluded->0,Color->Charcoal,Binding->Electronics,EAN->0685387040315,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Griffin Technology,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

"After having bought the ""Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod"" (and then promptly returned it because there was just too much static/interference), I decided to try the Griffin RoadTrip.  First, I was shocked at the difference in sound quality between the two products. The Griffin sounds crisp and clear and there is NO static!  I live in Boston and have set the frequency to 88.5 and have not had a single problem.  Second, the Griffin is so much more convenient and easier to use because you just plug it in and turn it on (it remembers whatever frequency you used previously).  No wires, no having to dangle my Nano around the rearview mirror just to get music to play (albeit with frequent static and a constant hissing sound in between songs), and I have a nice, solid, safe place to put my Nano that's right at my fingertips.  My only caution is that the holder-adapter that's designed to fit the Nano will only fit if I take mine out of the leather ""Marware"" protective cover I bought to keep it from getting all scratched up (I have the 2G Black one). An easy solution (at least for me) was to keep my leather cover on and simply use the ""larger"" holder instead of the smaller ""Nano-sized"" one.  Griffin conveniently provides two different thicknesses of padding to customize the fit for virtually all iPods (except the Shuffle, of course) so I just put in one of the pads and my Nano stays nice and secure and will never get scratched.  I highly recommend the RoadTrip and am frankly, shocked that others have rated it so poorly.

"After our son out grew his Graco Snug Ride infant car seat. We started to research convertibles car seats. The Britax Marathon's name came up in every online forum as well as writing reviews giving this seat very high ratings. We visited a local store in our area who carried the Britax Marathon as we wanted to see how it would fit our child. We were very pleased that the seat has a growth potential of up to 65 lbs and 49"" in height. This calculates that on average a child can stay in this seat in a five point harness until the approximate age of a five year old.....reassuring. As most seats on the market have five point harnesses that have a weight limit of 40lbs. The Marathon would allow us more long term growth instead of transitioning into a booster early on and bipassing the shoulder/lap belt combination. We shopped online and found that babies r us had a large selection. However the more we researched we found the prices to be considerably lower and made our purchase from travelingtikes.com. They had a great selection as well but the same seat was offered at $219.99 shipping included. Our seat arrived just a short four days later. The Britax's owners manual was easy to read and the seat installation with the LATCH system was simple to install. However I found it a little more difficult TETHER the seat in the rear facing postion. Once installed the seat was very secure and did not have any movement as compared to the our Graco infant seat. Our son seemed to be so happy from the get go. The harnesess were easy to adjust and we liked the fact that there was excellent side wall protection.

"As with any piece of expensive, portable technology, this new iPod requires a hands-on test drive. You need to get a sense as to just how portable it really is, whether it's solid enough for the journey, and, in the case of the iPod with video, just how good the screen really is under various light conditions. I've only had a few moments to check it out, but I'll share my observations. (Having had my nano screen break under normal usage on the very first day I owned it, I brought to the table a real concern about fragility, by the way. Apple, thankfully, replaced the broken nano with a new one, as they have acknowledged an apparent defect with some of the screens.) First, as you would expect, form and fit are first rate. The iPod seems to get smoother and more seamless with each generation. As with the nano, I think the scroll wheel has hit the sweet spot, too. Second, it seems more substantial and durable than the nano. Part of that has to do with the astounding thinness of the nano. There seems to be quite a bit more screen protection inherent in this iPod/video's design (and it is, after, considerably thicker than the nano, but still thin -- the 60 GB version is as thin as the 4th generation's 20 GB model, and the 30 GB is 30% thinner than that). Third, the screen is great. Clear, bright, and easy to read at a range of viewing angles (not that the latter is all that important for most iPods, but video changes all that ...). I must say, however, that it pales in comparison to the Sony PSP's gorgeous widescreen as a platform for watching videos. (The PSP's larger screen is a wonder, both for games and movies. Apple has obviously decided -- at least for the iPod -- to sacrifice optimal screen size for portability. More on that in a second.) Fourth, the slightly sour note. Once you've held the nano, used it, it makes this iPod feel too wide and heavy. Wide to a point where it doesn't easily nestle in the hand. It's the screen, of course, that is responsible. This is where you'll need to pick one up, hold it, check it out. It may be awkward to put in an armband for sports, for example. I found it consmetically less attractive because of that width, but, of course, you'll need to be the judge. Videos look great on it, as do photographs and album art. It's a great platform for catching with Lost -- or Desperate Housewives. But video comes at a price, of course. (Perhaps Apple could have changed the orientation of the screen so as to keep the width in check. Maybe. I'd have preferred that, I think.) The iPod/video is a compromise platform where, as Steve Jobs put it, video is ""icing on the cake."" It may be a bit too much icing for some, given the physical effects it had on design. For those folks, the nano is absolutely perfect, and rumor has it that the nano's capacity will get a jolt upward in the spring if the 2 GB or 4 GB models don't hold enough for your liking.

"As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk. From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist. I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place.

"Apple is, quite simply, the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. A recent article in Consumer Reports identified Apple computers as the most reliable computers and PC Magazine user surveys have reached the same conclusion. Furthermore, PC Magazine regularly designates the iMac G5 as the best all around desktop computer. Now the ultra-reliable, user friendly iMac G5 has an even faster G5 processor. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you really want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based PCs (including regular virus attacks) -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to viruses? If these virtues are more important to you than being one of the crowd, please seriously consider buying an Apple computer. This new iMac G5 is Apple's latest and fastest iteration of the innovative iMac series of compact, user friendly computers at reasonable prices. Like all G5-powered Apple computers this new iMac is a very fast computer -- more than twice as fast as a Pentium 4 with the same clock speed -- and has a state-of-the-art 64-bit processor. All computers will have 64-bit processors some day but very few PCs, except for Apple G5s, have them at this time.

"A Norton AV user for years, the upgrade to 2005 made sense.  Actually bought a 3-user package for my household's 3 PCs.  On 2 PCs, it slowed the PCs down considerably and causes system crashes on one. On the 3rd PC, it installed and activated fine, but the subscription expired (actually a previous version's subscription expired, not the current one, but it did not know that).  Re-installation did not work - activation of the software told me that the CD KEY is invalid (after long, long waits for the activation to run).  Symantec online diagnostics did not help.  Tech support performed an ""over the phone"" activation.  A few days later, the software said its trial period has ended and ceased to work.  Tech support (again) told me they would email me instructions that would definitely restore the software and 1 year subscription.  They never sent the email. Ultimately, I purchased another brand of AntiVirus software and will be asking for some money back from Norton (although I know that they will tell me I have to go back to the store I bought it from - too late for that). In summary, Notron 2005's performance reminds me of, well, like a virus on my PCs.  They've lost a long-time customer.

"Anyone considering purchasing this or any Archos product should be aware that based on my experience (4 Archos jukeboxes) their quality control is spotty at best. This used to be bearable because they used to have a fairly liberal warranty policy and would repair or exchange defective products no questions asked. That has changed. Now you have to go through an elaborate process of providing documentation of purchase, mailing the unit back at your own expense, insured, and waiting in silence while they decide what to do. In my case the little joystick that is the key control of the AV320 fell off. When I returned the unit to them for repair (they would not simply send me the part) they decided to keep the 80 gb hard drive I had installed in my AV320. Because they claim installing the drive voided the warranty they now say that they will not return MY drive to me unless I pay them $125 for the repair. Won't take back the replacement they sent me, won't send me a replacement part, won't give me my property back. Worst customer service I've ever seen.

"Apple is, quite simply, the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. A recent user survey in PC magazine identified Apple computers as the most reliable and easiest to use computers currently available and last year Apple's Power Macintosh G5 was designated computer of the year. Now the powerful 64-bit G5 processor is available in an elegant new iMac design. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based PCs -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to virus attacks? If these virtues are more important to you than being one of the crowd, please seriously consider buying an Apple computer. The new iMac G5 is Apple's latest iteration of the innovative iMac series of compact, user friendly computers at reasonable prices. Like all G5-powered Apple computers this new iMac is a very fast computer -- more than twice as fast as a Pentium 4 with the same clock speed -- and has a state-of-the-art 64-bit processor. All computers will have 64-bit processors some day but very few PCs, except for Apple G5s, have them at this time. If you're looking for a fast, versatile, easy to use computer (and want to stop worrying abut virus attacks) and are willing to try something off the beaten path, you'll love this elegant new iMac G5.

"As an engineer, consultant, businessman, and educator- pramatism (bang per buck) absolutely rules. No question- having suffered dozens of daily crashes with the latest PCs and Microsoft software, hundreds of OS updates, crippled unreliable Dell and IBM laptops (yet working in aerospace, space and formula one)- I am so P**sed off with the quality (lack thereof) in IT (17 years worth!)....Count the hours wasted and dollars spent on software... To the new Apple- within 5 minutes it was connected to the Internet, talking with all the printers, scanners, faxes, gamespads, videocams without any hitch whatsoever (REAL WOW). OK so OSX looks scary- 30 minutes to get used to without even looking at the straightfoward manual. Appleworks free office suite reads all my papers and articles without a glitch even though they were written (and crashed) in MS Office. Some software updates- quick with a disk optimiser automatically (no fragmented disks..). Speedwise an iMac G5 1.6/ 512MB RAM/160 GB HD/17 screen boots up and feels about 3 x faster than a Dell Inspiron Laptop/Pentium 4 1.6/512MB RAM/30GB HD/16VRAM/15 Screen. Never mind the cool factor or that an equivalent Dell costs more.. I even have to move my head from side to side as the screen is so big! Moans- more power would be great (e.g. better graphics card options, dual processor option) but in reality the iMac is such such a marvel of industrial design in the true sense, doesn/t crash all day, and works very effectively at a great price. BTW I did a factory 1 slot 512MB option so that could 3rd party upgrade another 512 more cost effectively- but am told that the 2 slots do not need to match in size. Overall- a real winner- My *New* Dell laptop has become a paperweight holding a cable! UPDATE (a few days later)- everyone who has seen and used the new iMac wants one; I *want to* use the computer (fun!) rather than dread it (Windows); think that office productivity - languishing despite vast IT investments- may rebound if coporations were brave enough to invest in one of these for all staffers... (not one crash in 40 hours use- a record!!!). BTW may start to put in some industrial strength engineering modelling apps soon (with a second new Mac- a Dual PowerMac 3GHz when it comes)...

"After I reviewed the review from other users, I can see that some users have problems on using this media but no one has provide any solution to resolve that.  Since I have no problem on using this media with my Sony DW-D26A DVD burner, I would like to share some of my experience with others. Both my Panasonic and Toshiba DVD player do not support DVD+R format.  After reading an article about changing booktype bitsettings, I tried to use K-probe v.2.4.2 (freeware)along with Nero 6.6.0.8, I was even able to change the booktype setting and made this disc read on my DVD player as DVD-ROM, not DVD+R. Both my DVD players played the disc fine. I even tried these burnt disc on a few of my friends DVD players such as Apex, Sony and JVC and the playback was flawless. I do not have any problem on burning these discs at 8x speed with my Sony DW-D26A.  My friend borrowed a few of this blank discs from me to backup some of his home movies on his older model Sony DW-D22A and he was able to burn it at 8x speed as well. A suggestion to other users with old model of DVD burner that you may have to check the official site of your DVD burner to get the up-to-date patch since the latest firmware can improve the writing strategy of the DVD burner and it enables your burner to accept more different brand of DVD disc.  :-) If some of you would like to find out more about changing booktype bitsetting, you can check out this link to find out whether your DVD burner would support this technology or not. http://www.k-probe.com",4/19/2005,9.0,7.0,A2YQS8DFQ7NUUU,B0002KQRB4,4.0,0.0,609306.0,39.0,"Good media, if you know what you are doing.",0.0,1,12120,Velocity,62.99,"Velocity DVD+R 4.7GB, 8x  (100-pack Spindle) Best Value",EAN->0780269141101,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Silver, printable top surface",Brand->Velocity,"Feature->Records at 2.4x to 8x, backwards compatible with existing DVD-ROM drives and DVD players",Manufacturer->Velocity,Model->14110,MPN->14110,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->Velocity,Studio->Velocity,"Title->Velocity DVD+R 4.7GB, 8x  (100-pack Spindle) Best Value",UPC->780269141101,,,"Feature->120 min, 4.7 GB capacity",Feature->Uses superb premium organic dye that ensures stable burning,Feature->Long archival and storage life,Label->Velocity,ListPrice
Adobe Premiere  is far from the most advanced non-linear video editing package you can get however let me make this one comment. - Editing is all about cutting and not fancy effects. The strength of the project is what is in front of and behind the camera not fancy effects. I would never recommend using any of the effects on any of the non-linear video editing packages anyway. Get dedicated effects packages if you really want to do your special effects well. In short Adobe Premiere is the BEST cutting software and the EASIEST to use. The learning curve is slightly steep but you will be cutting your footage within a day or two with this one. An editor cuts and arranges media. Adobe Premiere does that perfectly. I recommend this like no other for the price but if you are looking for pro packages then go elsewhere and be prepared to pay five figures with extra hardware. If you want special FX this has some but no pro uses these effects tool. Premiere is a first class cutting tool.

"After having a Memorex mp3 player die on me in the 4th month, I read a lot of reviews and the Muvo series seemed to get top marks for performance and reliability.  The Muvo Slim even got the top recommendation from a prestigious Consumer technology-review site.  One of the best things about it is the lithium ion rechargeable battery, which even recharges quickly through the USB port.  I went through a lot of batteries before.  Even if your mp3 player gets 10 hours on one battery, if you work out or walk to the bus stop every day, that can mean 1 battery per week -- that starts adding up quickly, believe me! I ended up going for the Muvo Micro instead, but that's only because it has an arm band, and I go running.  I actually like the credit card shape of the Slim better, and it fits excellently in a top pocket.  But I finally got my hands on one in person, and I noticed that the nice leather case doesn't have a place for a belt clip or strap, so even if I had created my own arm strap, there was no place to guide it through.

"At the first sight of the iPod Mini, only one word comes to mind: Wow. Many people are stunned at how small the iPod is for an MP3 player of its magnitude. If theese pople saw the mini, they would be absolutely amazed. It's small enough to put in your pocket, yet large enough to hold all your songs. The innovative click wheel is easy to use, and looks flashier than the 15, 20, and 40 GB models with it's brand new colors. The click wheel si better than the touch wheel on the regular Ipods.

"As the title of this post attests, I'm truly marvelled at this product. Apple is and is going to beat all the competitors in the MP3 player arena. WOW, this product is sleek from the moment you see the box. And once you open the box and see how much care Apple takes care of presentation, you'll realize that you made a good investment. The player is SO much compact and lighter than I expected. I used to own a Creative Nomad Zen (20 Gb) and sold it because it was rather bulky and the controls were really clumsy. in contrast, the iPod is very intuitive and yet powerful. The design is outstanding, and the features is more than worth the money. The sound is superb, and the EQ is very decent just as the included headphones are. If you look at the Price-Value relationship, iPod offers the most ""bang for the buck,"" if you pardon the cliche.

"A step up adapter is a good tool for getting the most out of your expensive filters. Graduated filters don't work so well using this technique, but imagine using one filter type for multiple thread sized lenses. Step-up rings can also be stacked to get even more use out of a single filter. Keep in mind though that the closer the filter is to the lens, the better the results will be. Another useful feature is that this step-up ring can be used to prevent vignetting. Sometimes a filter can produce vignetting, especially on wide angle lenses. Stacking filters may cause vignetting as well. If using the adapter ring with larger sized filters, the problem may be eliminated as the filter rings are expanded out beyond the lens. This Step-up ring is made of a sold and sturdy but light weight metal construction. I tend to pack a lot of equipment into my camera backpack and carry it all over the place. Not only does this tool reduce my equipment expense, but limits the number of items I carry around. The only problem I've seen with using a step-up adapter is that the lens hood at the same time is pretty much out of the question. This should be expected though as this is a common issue of any step-up ring adapter.

"After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my second favorite. I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates. I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for. The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and 2) the latch mechanism Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate --------------------------------------------- cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36"" Tall / fits 28""-48"" doorway width / 2"" bar to step over / gate opening 19"" -  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal. -  The gate opening is about 19"" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider. -  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it. -  It does come with its own extensions in 5"" and 10"" so it more easily fits the wider doorways. -  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33"" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5"" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75"" as needed). - It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far. I also just like the way the taller gate looks. - It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2"". - If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money. Kidco Center Gateway: --------------------- cost $85 & extensions $24 / gate is 29.5"" Tall / fits 29.25"" to 37.5"" doorway width / 1"" bar to step over / gate opening 22"" - Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22"". (This certainly won points from my 6'2"" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others). I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature. - This one also had the most secure latch feature. You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru. I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out. - This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75"" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75"" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become ""weaker"" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37"" and your door opening is 36.5"", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34""). -  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white. -  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1"" high (seems less of a tripping risk). -  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 8/04) -  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need. -  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up. -  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller. -  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it! First Years - Hands-Free Gate ----------------------------- cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32"" Tall / fits 29""-34"" doorway width / 1.5"" bar to step over / gate opening 17"" - My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17"" wide! I'm 5'8"" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However... - The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width. - Good height to the gate. - It was very sturdy in my doorway. - This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor. - Fits only up to 34"" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension. -  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one. All three gates seemed to: - Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly. - Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall. - Were pretty easy to set up. - All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look ""cheaper"" to me than the others. Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.   Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value. Good luck with your own purchase!",7/24/2005,117.0,115.0,A32FGHKCNU8P5U,B0000DEW91,5.0,1.0,642001.0,209.0,Good gate - see the comparisons to two others!,0.0,1,816,"Summer Infant, Inc.",69.99,"Summer Infant # 07060, Sure & Secure Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate",Brand->Summer Infant,BatteriesIncluded->0,EAN->0012914070604,Binding->Baby Product,"Feature->Fits doorways 28"" to 47.5"" wide","Label->Summer Infant, Inc.",ListPrice,"Manufacturer->Summer Infant, Inc.",Model->07060,MPN->7060,NumberOfItems->1,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->Baby Product,"Publisher->Summer Infant, Inc.",ReleaseDate->2006-07-01,"Studio->Summer Infant, Inc.","Feature->Extra tall at 36"" high","Feature->Includes one 5"", and one 10"" extension",Feature->Simple one handed operation,Feature->Door swings closed and locks automatically,ItemDimensions
"As there isn't a version 10 on Amazon.com I had to use this area to warn everyone. I turned on the computer this morning and booted up v. 10 as normal to listen to music while I did my thing. I have the deluxe version of 10 that I paid good money for and was astonished to see this morning that it had expired!!! All of the features that you pay good money for - super tagging etc...will no longer work until I pay them more money?!? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as you won't own the extra features you get over the free version YOU ARE SIMPLY LEASING THEM! Before today I would have given Music Match v. 10 5+ stars as the features are great and the speed is great for use with ripping and relabelling your music collection. As you can see from the other reviews, the On demand junk that they try to get you to pay more money for as well isn't worth anything either. Put simply, DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM MUSIC MATCH!! UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about the deluxe verison expiring as well as put in a report to the Bad Business Bureau. I received a response from Yahoo in response to my complaint to the Better Business Bureau a day later with a new registration key and an apology for the misundstanding (which I have to ask...what misunderstanding?) I sent a reply back asking if the key would expire but have heard nothing back yet (3 business days later). I received an e-mail from the Better Business Bureau today asking me if the problem was resolved because of what they sent me (new registration) I responded by telling them no, it's not resolved because I don't know if the key expires or not. I'll update again once I get a response. **Special Note** If you also plan on filing a complaint to the Better Business Bureau be advised that Yahoo now owns MusicMatch so fill it out with Yahoo's corporate address of 701 First Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1019 with phone number of: 408 349-3300 UPDATE PART 2: I finally received word back from Yahoo customer service that the new key will not expire.

"Anyone considering purchasing this or any Archos product should be aware that based on my experience (4 Archos jukeboxes) their quality control is spotty at best.  This used to be bearable because they used to have a fairly liberal warranty policy and would repair or exchange defective products no questions asked.  That has changed.  Now you have to go through an elaborate process of providing documentation of purchase, mailing the unit back at your own expense, insured, and waiting in silence while they decide what to do.

The strength of the project is what is in front of and behind the camera not fancy effects. I would never recommend using any of the effects on any of the non-linear video editing packages anyway. Get dedicated effects packages if you really want to do your special effects well. In short Adobe Premiere is the BEST cutting software and the EASIEST to use. The learning curve is slightly steep but you will be cutting your footage within a day or two with this one. An editor cuts and arranges media. Adobe Premiere does that perfectly. I recommend this like no other for the price but if you are looking for pro packages then go elsewhere and be prepared to pay five figures with extra hardware. If you want special FX this has some but no pro uses these effects tool. Premiere is a first class cutting tool. Go to Discreet products for FX.,3/25/2007,2.0,2.0,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000E8JLDA,5.0,0.0,665163.0,11.0,Cut,0.0,1,3626,Adobe,849.0,Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0,EAN->0718659493202,Binding->DVD-ROM,ESRBAgeRating->Rating Pending,Brand->Adobe,"Feature->Edit multiple-camera shoots quickly and easily.

"Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems. I never tried any recordings using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE.  I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1.  If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture.  This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue.  The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it.  I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card.  I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured.  I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card.  After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card).  BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards.  Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far.  The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).",3/1/2006,16.0,11.0,A1BWFY3BIUP9UF,B000DLBAHI,2.0,1.0,666384.0,4.0,I eventually returned this card due to several problems,0.0,1,16353,HAUPPAUGE,364.5,WINTV-PVR-500 Mce Bundle Kit,EAN->0785428002538,Binding->Electronics,Feature->Watch TV with the MyTV button on MCE,Brand->HAUPPAUGE,Feature->Watch one TV show while recording another,ItemDimensions,Label->HAUPPAUGE,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

"After a year of trying to find a humidifier that works and doesn't break or gets nasty, I will help everyone by giving you my observations.  First we tried those $25 cool mist humidifiers that require the $10 filters/wicks that need replacing every week because they are wrapped up with mold and are loud as an F-15 preparing to take off.  I have tried probably every one there is and at one count I had five different ones.  I don't remember the exact models, but Bemis and Holmes come to mind when I went to search for those always out of stock wicks.  I thought I would go to the warm mist humidifiers because of the apparent purifying of the water through the steaming process, and no wicks.  I put all my humidifiers near a heat/airvent (3'-4' away) approximately 3 feet off the floor on a small table to help dissipate the steam.  My first one of these was the Honeywell HWM450.  I really liked this one right out of the box.  I put it together as described, filled it up with water, set the humidistat to the desired setting and turned it on.  It immediately began spewing out the nice warm steam that the instructions said it would and kept our room (14' X 16') at a nice 45-50% humidity level according to my Oregon Scientific meter.  After every tank full, I would take it apart and inspect the mineral pad and clean or replace it as described.  This thing worked great, good steam, fairly accurate humidity reading (+/- 5%) and automatic operation, no problems until 29 days later (30 day return policy at store I bought it from) when it woke my wife and I from a nice sleep with a putrid plastic burning smell.  I jumped out of bed to see what it was and it was the HWM450.  I unplugged the thing and noticed it was sitting in water.  I took the tank and control unit off to see what was happening.   It appeared as if the heating element came separated from the base and let water seep through to the bottom, almost starting some type of fire or melting process.  I packed it up and took it back to the store where they graciously took it back.  I went to get another just like it thinking this was just a fluke, but luckily they were out and gave me a refund.  I then came to the internet and began searching for others.  Glad I did and read other reviews on this model so tossed out trying to get another.  I then went to Sears and bought a Kenmore 15124 3-gallon warm mist humidifier.  This is the one that needs cloth sleeves that fit over the heating element to absorb the minerals.  I set it up according to the directions and let it run all night.  On high setting, I could never get the room above 30%.  This was futile.  I boxed it up and took it back for a refund the next day.  I may not have given it a fair chance, but even the cool mist humidifiers would get to 35% within 3 hours.  I then found two Honeywell HWM-255's on clearance at the local big box.  I snatched those up and took them home, set them up as instructed by the enclosed book and let them rip.  One immediately started working and the other just sat there with a half working lcd display.  I never got it to work and I took it back.  The other one I set up in our bedroom and noticed the humidistat didn't give an accurate reading as tested with my Oregon Scientific hygrometer.  I did fiddle with it enough to get it to cycle on and off to the level I wanted using my OS hygrometer as a base line.  To get 45-50% humidity in the room, the HWM-255 had to be set on 75%.  Thus far, I like the one that works.  It seems easy enough to clean, no filters, wicks or mineral pads and the reservoir sits nicely upside down when filling.  Just have to wipe off the heating element every filling, but that is cheaper than those filters.  I then decided to get another one for a backup since these things seem to self-destruct regularly. Since I have one that apparently works, I was in no hurry to buy one.  I read some reviews and had a few models in mind and I would investigate them as I saw them in local stores.  I was in a local towel/linen store waiting on my wife one day when I saw a huge amount of steam coming from one corner. This caught my eye since I have been on this humidifier search now for a while.  I walked over and saw several models sitting on a pile of boxes with several TV's playing videos about each one.  After watching these videos on each model displayed, I proceeded to work the knobs and turn various ones on and off, take them apart and look inside them and just gave them a generally good going over.  After digesting all the info I then purchased a Venta Sonic VS100.  I couldn't make myself buy the Air O Swiss one, but if I had not bought so many before, I probably would have.  I took this one home, set it up according to the directions and turned it on.  It didn't take long for it to start working and within two hours, it had the bedroom up to 50% humidity from 30%. Its tank wasn't hard to fill, but it did take a moment to fill up the cartridge where the water fill is so would start letting water down to the heater.  When it reached the desired humidity level, I adjusted the two knobs on it to where it would cycle on and off.  It emptied the tank in one night and I finally got a good night sleep without waking up with dry throat.  This thing just spews out the nice steam/mist profusely.  With all this said, here are a few observations.  1) Don't rely on the built in humidistat (humidity indicator).  Have a separate one to measure your room's humidity.  It is better to have a dial type humidity controller that works than a digital one that doesn't.  2) Cheap prices on these things are not good.  You do get what you pay for.  It seems like the ones that the price started out >$90 is better.  Just buy 1 @ >$100, then 8 @ $30. 3) Keep your receipt and original packaging and buy from a vendor with a good return and customer service policy.  Chances are you'll have to return the cheap ones.  4) These reviews are fairly accurate and are good aids for decision making.  4) Cool mist humidifiers are germ factories.  5) If you buy one that requires replacement filters, cartridges, wicks, make sure they are readily available or stock up when you buy the unit.  6) Place a humidifier off the floor preferably not on top a heat vent and if you have a ceiling fan, turn it on.  7) Don't leave these things running without being watched until you know what they will do.  8) Get one size bigger than what you think you need.  Daily water output is a better indicator than room size capacity.  9) All these things do is introduce water into the air. Warmer air holds water better than cold air.

"As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk. From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist. I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place. Any Sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? They are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.

"After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the ""antenna aiming signal strength indicator"" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit.

"After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing.  I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed.  While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the ""antenna aiming signal strength indicator"" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces.  I can't hear any difference between the two.  Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same.

"Apple is, quite simply, the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. A recent article in Consumer Reports identified Apple computers as the most reliable computers and PC Magazine user surveys have reached the same conclusion. Furthermore, PC Magazine regularly designates the iMac G5 as the best all around desktop computer. Now the ultra-reliable, user friendly iMac G5 has an even faster G5 processor. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you really want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based PCs (including regular virus attacks) -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to viruses? If these virtues are more important to you than being one of the crowd, please seriously consider buying an Apple computer. This new iMac G5 is Apple's latest and fastest iteration of the innovative iMac series of compact, user friendly computers at reasonable prices. Like all G5-powered Apple computers this new iMac is a very fast computer -- more than twice as fast as a Pentium 4 with the same clock speed -- and has a state-of-the-art 64-bit processor. All computers will have 64-bit processors some day but very few PCs, except for Apple G5s, have them at this time. If you're looking for a fast, versatile, easy to use computer, want to stop worrying abut virus attacks, and are willing to try something off the beaten path, you'll love this elegant and now faster new iMac G5.

"Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund. I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).",3/14/2006,13.0,10.0,A1BWFY3BIUP9UF,B0006G33UW,2.0,1.0,722892.0,18.0,I eventually returned this tuner card due to several problems.,0.0,1,0,HAUPPAUGE,0.0,Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-500MCE 2-Tuner PCI-Based Digital Video Recorder (NTSC),"Feature->PCI-based digital video encoder and recorder designed for Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 and, with limited functionality, Windows XP",Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Features 2 NTSC TV tuners, each with its own hardware MPEG encoder so you can watch one channel while recording another",Brand->HAUPPAUGE,"Feature->Pause live TV, replay segments, and skip forward, all while your other TV show continues to be recorded to your PC's hard disk",Label->HAUPPAUGE,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

"After having a Memorex mp3 player die on me in the 4th month, I read a lot of reviews and the Muvo series seemed to get top marks for performance and reliability. The Muvo Slim even got the top recommendation from a prestigious Consumer technology-review site. One of the best things about it is the lithium ion rechargeable battery, which even recharges quickly through the USB port. I went through a lot of batteries before. Even if your mp3 player gets 10 hours on one battery, if you work out or walk to the bus stop every day, that can mean 1 battery per week -- that starts adding up quickly, believe me! I ended up going for the Muvo Micro instead, but that's only because it has an arm band, and I go running. I actually like the credit card shape of the Slim better, and it fits excellently in a top pocket. But I finally got my hands on one in person, and I noticed that the nice leather case doesn't have a place for a belt clip or strap, so even if I had created my own arm strap, there was no place to guide it through.

"After reading many reviews of the fm transmittion criteria, I found  myself in the market for one. The best reviews that I could find where the Monster IcarPlay (newer) and the Kensington 33185, I could not find either specific model anywhere near me, so I went down to the local bestbuy and got myself the Griffin RoadTrip. I was quite skeptical to see how this would perform because I read many negative reviews regarding Griffin products. After purchasing it for $118 CAD (about $105 US), I went in the car and tried it out. the set up is quite basic and after a few minutes I was listening to my nano with decent sound quality (same as local radio stations). I live in the biggest suburbia in North America, Mississauga, Ontario and the transmittion is quite good. Pros: It does not skip, even as the ipod wiggles from the road bumps It stays in tact Easy to use Good sound quality Comes with everything you need, every ipod model capability Can be used with your PC or Mac to transmit sound for you home stereo Convinient comes with Doc+holder+clip (s) Cons Constant access to the ipod battery could mean that the battery's life is ending faster than it should. the sound quality isn't top notch. (after all it is a transmitter, very minor complaint) Ipod users limit your sounds to minimum when the ipod is playing because it will not have an effect on the transmittion at all. This is probabbly a good thing. Over all I'd like to give it a 5, but 4 seemes more appropriate, due to price and capability.

"After having bought the ""Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod"" (and then promptly returned it because there was just too much static/interference), I decided to try the Griffin RoadTrip. First, I was shocked at the difference in sound quality between the two products! The Griffin sounds crisp and clear and there is NO static! I live in Boston and have set the frequency to 88.5 and have not had a single problem. Second, the Griffin is so much more convenient and easier to use because you just plug it in and turn it on (it remembers whatever frequency you used previously). No wires, no having to dangle my Nano around the rearview mirror just to get music to play (albeit with frequent static and a constant hissing sound in between songs), and best of all, I now have a nice, solid, safe place to put my Nano that's right at my fingertips. My only caution is that the holder-adapter that's designed to fit the Nano will only fit if I take mine out of the leather ""Marware"" protective cover I bought to keep it from getting all scratched up (I have the 2G Black one). An easy solution (at least for me) was to keep my leather cover on and simply use the ""larger"" holder instead of the smaller ""Nano-sized"" one. Griffin conveniently provides two different thicknesses of padding to customize the fit for virtually all iPods (except the Shuffle, of course) so I just put in one of the pads and my Nano stays nice and secure and will never get scratched. I highly recommend the RoadTrip and am frankly, shocked that others have rated it so poorly.

"A Norton AV user for years, the upgrade to 2005 made sense. Actually bought a 3-user package for my household's 3 PCs. On 2 PCs, it slowed the PCs down considerably and causes system crashes on one. On the 3rd PC, it installed and activated fine, but the subscription expired (actually a previous version's subscription expired, not the current one, but it did not know that). Re-installation did not work - activation of the software told me that the CD KEY is invalid (after long, long waits for the activation to run). Symantec online diagnostics did not help. Tech support performed an ""over the phone"" activation. A few days later, the software said its trial period has ended and ceased to work. Tech support (again) told me they would email me instructions that would definitely restore the software and 1 year subscription. They never sent the email. Ultimately, I purchased another brand of AntiVirus software and will be asking for some money back from Norton (although I know that they will tell me I have to go back to the store I bought it from - too late for that).

"As an engineer, consultant, businessman, and educator- pramatism (bang per buck) absolutely rules. No question- having suffered dozens of daily crashes with the latest PCs and Microsoft software, hundreds of OS updates, crippled unreliable Dell and IBM laptops (yet working in aerospace, space and formula one)- I am so P**sed off with the quality (lack thereof) in IT (17 years worth!)....Count the hours wasted and dollars spent on software... To the new Apple- within 5 minutes it was connected to the Internet, talking with all the printers, scanners, faxes, gamespads, videocams without any hitch whatsoever (REAL WOW). OK so OSX looks scary- 30 minutes to get used to without even looking at the straightfoward manual. Appleworks free office suite reads all my papers and articles without a glitch even though they were written (and crashed) in MS Office. Some software updates- quick with a disk optimiser automatically (no fragmented disks..). Speedwise an iMac G5 1.6/ 512MB RAM/160 GB HD/17 screen boots up and feels about 3 x faster than a Dell Inspiron Laptop/Pentium 4 1.6/512MB RAM/30GB HD/16VRAM/15 Screen. Never mind the cool factor or that an equivalent Dell costs more.. I even have to move my head from side to side as the screen is so big! Moans- more power would be great (e.g. better graphics card options, dual processor option) but in reality the iMac is such such a marvel of industrial design in the true sense, doesn/t crash all day, and works very effectively at a great price. BTW I did a factory 1 slot 512MB option so that could 3rd party upgrade another 512 more cost effectively- but am told that the 2 slots do not need to match in size. Overall- a real winner- My *New* Dell laptop has become a paperweight holding a cable! UPDATE (a few days later)- everyone who has seen and used the new iMac wants one; I *want to* use the computer (fun!) rather than dread it (Windows); think that office productivity - languishing despite vast IT investments- may rebound if coporations were brave enough to invest in one of these for all staffers...

"After I reviewed the review from other users, I can see that some users have problems on using this media but no one has provide any solution to resolve that. Since I have no problem on using this media with my Sony DW-D26A DVD burner, I would like to share some of my experience with others. Both my Panasonic and Toshiba DVD player do not support DVD+R format. After reading an article about changing booktype bitsettings, I tried to use K-probe v.2.4.2 (freeware)along with Nero 6.6.0.8, I was even able to change the booktype setting and made this disc read on my DVD player as DVD-ROM, not DVD+R. Both my DVD players played the disc fine. I even tried these burnt disc on a few of my friends DVD players such as Apex, Sony and JVC and the playback was flawless. I do not have any problem on burning these discs at 8x speed with my Sony DW-D26A.

"A step up adapter is a good tool for getting the most out of your expensive filters. Graduated filters don't work so well using this technique, but imagine using one filter type for multiple thread sized lenses. Step-up rings can also be stacked to get even more use out of a single filter. Keep in mind though that the closer the filter is to the lens, the better the results will be. Another useful feature is that this step-up ring can be used to prevent vignetting. Sometimes a filter can produce vignetting, especially on wide angle lenses. Stacking filters may cause vignetting as well. If using the adapter ring with larger sized filters, the problem may be eliminated as the filter rings are expanded out beyond the lens. This Step-up ring is made of a sold and sturdy but light weight metal construction. I tend to pack a lot of equipment into my camera backpack and carry it all over the place. Not only does this tool reduce my equipment expense, but limits the number of items I carry around.

"After reading the reviews on both, I was undecided whether to buy the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Champ. So I bought both and tried them side-by-side. I got the Genie on sale for $19, plus the an extra insert for $5. I bought the Champ for $25 after a $5 coupon. I brought them home and first set up the Genie for it's two-week test run. I loved it. Since it seals each diaper individually, you don't have to throw out a whole bag for a few days worth of diapers. And yes, you'll want to empty it out every three to four days. But that's no problem: press the cut button, give it a turn, two at the most, take the unit to the garbage and open the bottom. The sausage links fall out and you tie up the top again. Easy, clean, no need to mess with the diapers themselves. Then I set up the Champ. It almost got boxed up its first day. It did almost nothing to control the smell. So I emptied it out and exchanged it, thinking I must have bought a defective one. Nope. The next one was just as bad. I could smell the first messy diaper immediately. Essentially, it's a trash can with an allegedly smell proof lid, but it can't even accomplish that. Then when it's time to empty it out, you are back to emptying a trash can, which means opening the lid, exposing the diapers to the air, and throwing out an essentially empty garbage bag. You will change the bag every day or two. It smells bad. Very. So it's all well and fine that you can use any suitably sized trash bag in it, but you'll go through them that much faster, too. To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it. One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods. The Champ may be nice for newborns with their odorless diapers, since all you have to do is insert diaper and flip the handle, but in my opinion, by the time your kids get to solid foods and the resulting odor, stick with the Genie.",2/5/2006,8.0,7.0,A2B05PNA67H4IJ,B0001NE8OA,4.0,1.0,762027.0,185.0,Genie v.

Files take longer to save in Adobe Acrobat 6, but they do end up being smaller, so maybe there is a more advanced compression algorithm at work. Nevertheless, files do take about twice as long to save in the new version. Furthermore, at least for my line of work, I see no useful additions to the software.

Avoid RCA DirecTV products like the plague. We bought a 3-room system and in just under a year one of the receivers died. On the advice of their customer service (who blamed the problem on DirecTV software) we waited to see if the problem cleared up. Then they told us it was out of warranty when we later asked for a replacement! RCA is junk and their service is arrogant and dishonorable.

"After reading many mixed reviews of this dish I'm glad I finally just went ahead and ordered it. It is such a nice design - handsome and clean lines with great colors, it makes my whole kitchen look and feel a little bit 'cutting edge' or 'modern' (I'm not kidding, even my husband thinks this set is ""cool"") and the spoons are my baby's favorite (he's 7 months old) My 2 and 3 year old toddlers like to use the spoons too! I am writing to clear up a few misconceptions that other reviewers had mentioned; here's what I found: first of all, my set came with two spoons in different colors and one bowl. The bowl and the rim are separate pieces that snap together too firmly for baby to take apart, but might come apart if the bowl hits the floor like ours did (but it did not break and I can't imagine that it ever will). The rim is sort of rubbery and skid-resistant, the plastic bowl hangs suspended from the rim and the 'splayed' design of the rim allows for a lot of baby's reaching in and pushing food around and out without it tipping. This is not the case with 'normal'/traditional bowl-shaped baby dishes which tilt, rock, roll and then go spinning off the highchair tray. It's not tip-proof, it does not suction to the tray and your baby will eventually figure out how to pick it up. But, even after my little guy figured all that out, he still seems more interested in chasing his food around and then victoriously jamming it into his mouth with the sloping sides of the dish really helping him to get the job done. (He's still using his fingers at this point, the spoon is for me to help him right now). You can wash this in a dishwasher (yay!) you can use it in a microwave too (yay!) but take care never to 'boil' the food, just zap very briefly to gently warm up cold mac-n-cheese, for example. (The lable warns not to exceed 194 degrees). The spoons are wonderful; hard plastic with a rounded edge (that is gentle on baby's still toothless gums) to scoop the food while the handle is rubbery and easy for baby to hold and/or chomp on while those teeth work their way on out.

"After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates. I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanism Kidco Center Gateway: --------------------- cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5"" Tall  / fits 29.25"" to 37.5"" doorway width  / 1"" bar to step over / gate opening 22"" -  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22"".  (This certainly won points from my 6'2"" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature. -  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out. - This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75"" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75"" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become ""weaker"" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37"" and your door opening is 36.5"", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34""). -  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white. -  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1"" high (seems less of a tripping risk). -  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04) -  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need. -  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up. -  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller. -  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it! Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate --------------------------------------------- cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36"" Tall / fits 28""-48"" doorway width / 2"" bar to step over / gate opening 19"" -  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal. -  The gate opening is about 19"" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider. -  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it. -  It does come with its own extensions in 5"" and 10"" so it more easily fits the wider doorways. -  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33"" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5"" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75"" as needed). -  It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks. -  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2"". -  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money. First Years - Hands-Free Gate ----------------------------- cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32"" Tall  / fits 29""-34"" doorway width / 1.5"" bar to step over / gate opening 17"" - My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17"" wide! I'm 5'8"" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However... - The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width. - Good height to the gate. - It was very sturdy in my doorway. - This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor. - Fits only up to 34"" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension. -  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one. All three gates seemed to: - Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly. - Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall. - Were pretty easy to set up. - All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look ""cheaper"" to me than the others. Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.   Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value.

The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and 2) the latch mechanism First Years - Hands-Free Gate ----------------------------- cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32"" Tall / fits 29""-34"" doorway width / 1.5"" bar to step over / gate opening 17"" - My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17"" wide! I'm 5'8"" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However... - The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width. - Good height to the gate. - It was very sturdy in my doorway. - This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor. - Fits only up to 34"" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension. -  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one. Kidco Center Gateway: --------------------- cost $85 & extensions $24 / gate is 29.5"" Tall / fits 29.25"" to 37.5"" doorway width / 1"" bar to step over / gate opening 22"" - Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22"". (This certainly won points from my 6'2"" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others). I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature. - This one also had the most secure latch feature. You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru. I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out. - This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75"" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75"" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become ""weaker"" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37"" and your door opening is 36.5"", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34""). -  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white. -  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1"" high (seems less of a tripping risk). -  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 8/04) -  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need. -  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up. -  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller. -  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it! Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate --------------------------------------------- cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36"" Tall / fits 28""-48"" doorway width / 2"" bar to step over / gate opening 19"" -  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal. -  The gate opening is about 19"" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider. -  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it. -  It does come with its own extensions in 5"" and 10"" so it more easily fits the wider doorways. -  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33"" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5"" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75"" as needed). - It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far. I also just like the way the taller gate looks. - It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2"". - If if fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money. All three gates seemed to: - Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly. - Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall. - Were pretty easy to set up. - All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look ""cheaper"" to me than the others. Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.   Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value.

"After reading the reviews on both, I was undecided whether to buy the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Champ. So I bought both and tried them side-by-side. I got the Genie on sale for $19, plus the an extra insert for $5. I bought the Champ for $25 after a $5 coupon. I brought them home and first set up the Genie for it's two-week test run. I loved it. Since it seals each diaper individually, you don't have to throw out a whole bag for a few days worth of diapers. And yes, you'll want to empty it out every three to four days. But that's no problem: press the cut button, give it a turn, two at the most, take the unit to the garbage and open the bottom. The sausage links fall out and you tie up the top again. Easy, clean, no need to mess with the diapers themselves. Then I set up the Champ. It almost got boxed up its first day. It did almost nothing to control the smell. So I emptied it out and exchanged it, thinking I must have bought a defective one. Nope. The next one was just as bad. I could smell the first messy diaper immediately. Essentially, it's a trash can with an allegedly smell proof lid, but it can't even accomplish that. Then when it's time to empty it out, you are back to emptying a trash can, which means opening the lid, exposing the diapers to the air, and throwing out an essentially empty garbage bag. You will change the bag every day or two. It smells bad. Very. So it's all well and fine that you can use any suitably sized trash bag in it, but you'll go through them that much faster, too. To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it. One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods. The Champ may be nice for newborns with their odorless diapers, since all you have to do is insert diaper and flip the handle, but in my opinion, by the time your kids get to solid foods and the resulting odor, stick with the Genie. Incidentally, one insert lasted me one month for a one-year-old and a three-year-old who has occasional accidents in her nap-time pull-up.",2/5/2006,4.0,2.0,A2B05PNA67H4IJ,B00003TL7P,1.0,1.0,1016404.0,246.0,Diaper Champ v.
