527136,A1GZ9GH5XTGNV0,0,0,10,B000ETVKHE,7/16/2006,1,8,22,mark my words: THIS THING IS [...],"I recently bought this sansa at Best Buy, and I very much regret the purchase. I was just goint to Best Buy because I was looking into buying some sort of MP3 player (not necessarily an ipod because they are a lot more expensive than other brands) to hold about 4 GB of music. When telling this to one of the employees, she pretty much talked me into buying a Sansa e260. She definitely had very good reasons for getting a sansa over an ipod nanos: sansa's are a lot cheaper for the same amount of storage capacity, sansa's are more durable than nanos, sansa's have an FM tuner included and nanos don't...the list goes on and on. A big deal for getting an mp3 player was being able to charge it on the go because I'm going on a lot of trips this year and I'm not always gonna have access to a computer. Even though Sandisk does not make a charger specifically made for the Sansa, the employee at Best buy assured me that I could buy a Griffin brand wall charger made for an ipod and it would charge it. I guess I made a mistake on my part howeve because I bought the sansa with the wall charger in the beginning of July, right before leaving on vacation. After charging the sansa right when I got it, it stayed charged all week (to avoid having to charge it all the time, I set the backlight on dim and had it turn off after 5 seconds) into my vacation. After a couple days of long car rides, my sansa needed to be charged so I plugged it in correctly to my wall charger and left it to charge overnight. Unfortunately, nothing happened and my mp3 died. I coulnd't get it to turn on or do anything the rest of the trip. I even went to walmart during my vacation to try a new charger to see if it was just the charger but it failed to charge with it. This is when I knew that this thing was a piece of crap and I was disappointed because I had no music for the rest of my vacation. Pros - *long battery charge if you don't always leave the backlight on *FM tuner *good sound when using good ear phones (more about that in the cons) *easy to load music onto using my already organized music library on window's media player *very durable and fit well in my hand *easy to get around (I liked how all of the menus were organized) Cons - *wouldn't charge with a wall charger!!! (although, when reading some of the reviews on here, I guess a wall charger worked for them) *adding songs to the ""Go List"" is annoying because you have to play each song you want to add individually *the ear phones that come with them have horrible sound and don't fit in my ears. Also, the little foam things that cover the ear phones fall off so easily. It's too bad though because I really liked my sansa and how it worked overall. I'm getting an ipod nano soon though because I'm done dealing with crap. Now I know why ipods are more expensive. It's also nice how you actually can find all of the accessories you need for ipod anywhere.",3,53,SanDisk,249.99,Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot,Brand->SanDisk,BatteriesIncluded->0,ClothingSize->4 GB,Binding->Electronics,Color->Black,"Feature->Convert most popular video formats (MPEG-4, WMV, DivX) to play on device",Feature->User-replaceable rechargeable lithium-ion battery for up to 20 hours of life,Format->CD,HardDiskSize->4,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->SanDisk,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

574207,A3EDVUU7LRFZEJ,0,0,7,B0007QKMSC,2/13/2006,2,25,108,I Hate This Camera,"In my opinion, this camera suffers from a couple of serious problems that makes it an extremely poor choice for anyone looking for a professional-level DSLR: 1). It's trying to be too many things to too many levels of photographer.  Canon is clearly going for the consumer/semi-professional/professional market.  In my opinion it turns a potentially great camera into an expensive gadget.  Too many features, too many menu options, too many automatic modes--in short, too much of everything.  Imagine buying a car that has manual AND automatic transmission and is a combination hard-top/rag-top convertible with disc and drum brakes front and back, an AM/FM radio, CD player, cassette player, 8-track tape player, reel-to-reel player, record player, and a 16-track digital recording studio.  ""Cool!"" you say?  Buy this camera right now.  I'm looking for a good quality DSLR to replace my standard SLR.  This camera has way too many gee-whiz features designed to appeal to the consumer market.  It makes it a pain in the arse to use--unless you want those features, of course.  I don't. 2). You can't use the display as a viewfinder.  This is a huge deal-killer, in my opinion.  One of the great advantages of a digital camera is the ability to use the onscreen display for setting up your shots.  I understand they're trying to maximize battery life, but a digital camera where you CAN NOT use the display while you're shooting is absurd. 3). Terrible macro mode.  Not just average.  Terrible.  You definitely need an optional macro lens in order to take decent macro photos with this camera.  Otherwise, you're going to be stuck with Canon's bizarre decision to force the use of flash in macro mode (you get to choose between no flash mode or macro mode in the auto settings (but not both(?)) or manual mode with an optional lens).  Buying a closeup lens for a high-end camera is reasonable to expect, I suppose, except that I've never run into this problem with ANY other digital camera I've used.  Most are great for quick-and-dirty macro photography right out of the box. 4). The dumbest manual white-balance procedure I've ever seen in my life.  Use it.  I dare you. 5). Incredibly lousy manual.  Standard feature for ALL cameras these days, I know.  Doesn't excuse the fact, however. Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT camera that takes excellent pictures and works as advertised.  It just not anywhere close to what I was looking for.  Canon could have skipped 80% of the features and simplified a few others and I would have kept this camera.  For now, I'll stick to my Sony DSC-H1 for snaps and my trusty old Nikon and Canon F-1 for the rest.",3,130,Canon,599.99,Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only - Black),DisplaySize->1.8,Binding->Electronics,EAN->0013803049565,Brand->Canon,Feature->8.0-megapixel CMOS sensor captures enough detail for photo-quality 16 x 22-inch prints,HasRedEyeReduction->1,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Canon,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

We purchased the Uranium Ore to improve upon our custom fashion watches by making the hands glow in the dark.  Unfortunately, my dad - who is SUPPOSED to have a degree in Engineering and Physics confused Uranium with Radium.  We need Radium ore to make the hands of the watch glow in the dark at night and not Uranium.  Uranium ore is useless for this task, regardless of the jokes you see here about ""dogs glowing in the dark"" and nonsense like that. I don't want to come across as critical, but there are some of us who do not take these reviews lightly and it would have saved us a lot of money if the reviews here didn't misleadingly cause my dad to think that Uranium ore would make the hands of the watch glow in the dark. That said, does anyone know where we can get some radium ore?  Thanks! P.S.  I have found a great resource that goes well with this product.

I have a simple home network that's probably like everybody else's - a DSL modem and a consumer-grade Linksys firewall/router/wireless access point.  Sometimes I could print and sometimes I couldn't.   It was very confusing, because sometimes printing worked just fine. I figured it out - when you installed the HP software on each PC, it writes the DHCP-assigned address of the printer (at the time of install) into etc/hosts. The IP address of the device written into etc/hosts is the IP address at the time you run the HP install software, but of course because this was temporarily assigned by DHCP, this may no longer be the IP address of the printer the next time you turn on the printer!! This means the DHCP server will assign the home computer(s) and printer with arbitrary addresses based on the order in which they are powered on. So it is inevitable that at some point the printer will obtain a DHCP-assigned address different than what it was assigned when you installed the HP software, and you won't be able to print! I'm not a networking expert by any means, but it strikes me as **spectacularly stupid** for the install process to write a temporary, DHCP-assigned address into etc/hosts, when the device will obtain a new IP address when the DHCP lease expires or the device is restarted!!! Why does the HP install process *do* this?!?! Given that the default setting of the printer when you take it out of the box and plug it in is to obtain it's IP address dynamically from a DHCP server, and that pretty much every home customer who buys one of these printers will plug it into a home Linksys or DLink router with a DHCP server, it is really dumb for the HP install process to write this temporarily obtained printer IP address into etc\hosts. Gee, almost every home user who purchases this printer will connect it to standard home router like a Linksys, which will be configured with DHCP because that's the default for every home router box. The Photosmart device is a great printer but the software and install appears that it wasn't developed by people who knew anything at all about what they were doing!  It certainly wasn't tested in a representative home network.",3,17688,Hewlett Packard,299.99,HP PhotoSmart PSC 2610 All-in-One Printer,Connectivity->USB,Binding->Electronics,EAN->0829160502274,Brand->Hewlett-Packard,"Feature->Color prints, photo prints, copies, scans, and faxes",Label->Hewlett Packard,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Hewlett Packard,Model->Q5542A#ABA,MPN->Q5542A#ABA,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->Hewlett Packard,Studio->Hewlett Packard,Title->HP PhotoSmart PSC 2610 All-in-One Printer,UPC->829160502274,"Feature->Up to 30 ppm print speed, up to 4,800 x 1,200 dpi resolution","Feature->Up to 30 cpm, reduces and enlarges 25 to 400%","Feature->2,400 x 4,800 dpi scan resolution, 48-bit color","Feature->USB, PictBridge, and 802.3 Ethernet connectivity; PC and Mac compatible",ItemDimensions
