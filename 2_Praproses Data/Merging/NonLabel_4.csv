I've been very happy with my Pentax IQZoom90WR for six years and I wanted to see if the 370z could replace it for most situations. LENS QUALITY:  Indistinguishable except in HDTV mode at small focal lengths where  curvature is noticable at the sides. Still acceptable. RESOLUTION:  Indistinguishable on 4x6/4x7 prints at ASA 100 and 200. Lack of precise  definition of edges with ASA 400 but still acceptable. If you want to blow  up the photo to 8x10, you'll want to use ASA 100 and that will limit you to  bright light situations. If I decide to do night photography outdoors (like  the Disneyland parade), I'll switch back to my 35mm using ASA 400. (I  should note however that the 370z performed well. I'm just a bit of a  perfectionist.) RED-EYE REDUCTION: Not as effective as my Pentax IQZ90WR.  Based on the shots I've taken, red-eye occurs in 10-15% of my face-on flash  shots. The occurence with my Pentax is less than 1% but it does use a  pre-flash whereas the 370z uses a mini-lamp. PORTABILITY: Excellent! Put it  into its case and strap it to your belt and you won't know it's there. This  is a BIG plus of the 370z since it allows you to enjoy your environment as  well as be a photographer. The worst shot in the world is the one you  didn't take because you didn't have your camera with you. FOCAL LENGTHS:  Comparable but the 370z is a step-zoom whereas my 35mm has a continuous  zoom. This is not much of a problem since you'll rarely encounter a  situation that requires absoultely precise framing with a zoom. FRAME  FORMATS: Panoramic mode shows too much grain at ASAs 200 and above.  Thankfully there's ...MID-ROLL CARTRIDGE CHANGE: Excellent feature! Allowed  me to switch to ASA400 at night and ASA100 when the sun was bright.  WISHLIST ITEM: If only it were weather-resistant or splash-proof. SUMMARY:  It's replaced my 35mm point-and-shoot for documenting my family's vacations  and daily activities but I still keep my 35mm in a suitcase or the car for  rainy days, special night shots, or situations where I might want a photo  blown-up to 8x10. This camera is well designed for its target market; the  average photographer who wants to capture day-to-day shots."

It's made of soft leather with nothing to scratch the camera body.  Too many aftermarket (even Canon branded) cases have zippers which will scratch the silver edges of the ELPH cameras.

It was so easy to use; I could switch film while riding a bike!  I got just about to the end of the third roll of film when the ""dreaded H"" reared its ugly head.  Following the manual's advice, I took out the battery, replaced it, and... it rewound/exposed the whole roll.  Since it was under warranty, we took it to the camera shop to have it repaired.  The owner told us he got this problem with Elphs a lot, and if we had this problem again, we'd be better off purchasing a new, different camera than paying to have it fixed."

I own a 35mm SLR as well -- but I never have it with me.  The Elph is so small I take it everywhere, with the result that I take many more pictures!  It's trivial to use and the picture  quality is great for a point'n'shoot camera -- it's definitely managed to  pull some good photos out of difficult situations.  I'd recommend this  model over the non-zoom models, because I've found having the zoom helps a  lot, especially with APS (which you don't want to enlarge too much)."

The kids (girl 4 and boy 2) loved it.  AND after awhile it started to grow on me too. Most importantly it accomplished its mission.  My youngest who had previously shown no interest in colors and shapes --other than to jump and slide on them-- now knows his stuff.  Not just circles and squares but octagons and hexagons too.  In addition, it teaches how colors can be mixed to produce new colors.

This video is excellent for those who want their kids to learn more than just the basic shapes.  My DH and I have even learned shapes we didn't know right off the top of our heads.  I'm excited to think that my children will be able to identify a heptagon from a hexagon, and know the difference between an ellipse and an oval etc. etc. all before they even reach elementary school.  I like how the video starts out with a catchy tune for colors that is very simple and moves along in difficulty until it reaches the various shapes and counting section where it moves to the names of shapes from squares all the way to the 10 sided decagon then it works on counting to 20 using colors and shapes.  I highly recommend this video, it is a much better option than letting a child sit and watch 46 minutes of TV that does all the thinking for them and in the process basically puts their brain to sleep.  There's no sleeping with this video, it is very visually stimulating.  It would be a great tool for preschool teachers and daycare, as well as a wonderful tape for Grandma and Grandpa to keep on hand for those ""long"" babysitting days.

Reception is horrible. Tuning a station I wanted meant turning the radio ever so slightly, propping it with a wash cloth, moving the antennae and then stepping back 10 feet. If I touched it, the reception gets scrambled and I had to start over again. It was worse than the $10 radio I was trying to replace which didn't even have an external antennae to deal with. The key word in the product description that I missed is water RESISTANT, not water PROOF. The battery compartment was in no way sealed to prevent water leaking in, just a standard battery door you find on your remote control. I'm sure had I kept it, water would have leaked in quickly and corroded the thing. Lastly, even though it has a strap to hang it, its meant for a counter top.

After looking at various models online or in stores, I am pleased with my purchase of this model.  It is a pedestal model that I can place easily  it on the shelf in my shower.  It also comes with a nice detachable lanyard if you need to hang it up in the shower.  The presets are easy to setup and use. I appreciate having the weather band easily available."

I'm so sorry I didn't buy the Sony sooner!  The sound quality is tremendous.  It isn't waterproof but I keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem.  I love the big preset selection (including local TV channels), the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own.  Great machine."
1048848,A13B4KEXELOHGE,0,1,18,B00000DM9W,10/19/2006,5,0,0,So good we use it outside the shower,"This was one of the few gifts that I gave to my husband that he really liked.  It's been more than two years and he still uses it everyday and so do I.  Sometimes we have to search the apartment for it because one of us will carry it from shower to bedroom to living room to kitchen. One criticism - the waterproof skin over the controls is not as resilient as it should be.  After 2 years of use, a little spot flaked off the protective skin over the ""on"" button.  We suspect this will be the beginning of its deterioration as the controls get wet."

We all keep it right in our showers.  Like many of the other people who have written reviews, my parents' and boyfriend's buttons have cracked and peeled away, but I have not had this problem.  My shower is a bathtub/shower combo so it's pretty long and I keep it toward the back of the shower away from the spray, while they both have shower stalls so the radio is much closer to the spray; I think this is why they've had the problems and I haven't.  Other than the button problem, this radio is great.  Always gets great reception, easy to tune and the timer is wonderful.  Highly recommended."

The sound is clear and there's no static.  I like that the on/off and tuning buttons are on the top of the radio because it's easy to reach up a push them rather than fiddle with buttons on the front of the radio.  One push and I'm on my favorite music station, and then with another push I can get the latest traffic from the ""all news"" station.  I don't use the television sound band but I tried it and the reception is just as clear as the other bands.  The weather radio is a nice touch and I have found it handy when there is stormy weather coming.  Also, the large volume knob makes it easy to adjust the volume with soapy hands especially when you need to know if the phone is ringing or if there's someone at the front door. The only thing wrong with this radio is that it is not water proof, just water resistant.  That sounds kind of weird for a ""SHOWER RADIO"" but that's what the instructions say.  The radio should not be exposed to direct water spray.  Luckily for me I have a shelf in my shower that doesn't get sprayed with water and that's where I have the radio.  I would definitely buy this radio again."

Excellent design features that one would expect from Sony:  all buttons are the membrane type, so no worry about water seeping into the unit;  all digital tuning, it locks in the stations beautifully, even the TV and weather band.  Will go for months without need of fresh batteries.  (I play mine about 1/2 hour daily). The only minor disappointment is tone quality.  Frequency response could be little wider on both the low and high ends. But hey, how high of performance can you expect for any waterproof speaker?"

I've got this little jewel sitting on the toilet tank where it can project sound into the entire bathroom! I love having the waterproof controls on the top and the station presets.  This radio also has very good reception, bringing in one of the weaker stations I like loud and clear. My one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom.  That means the designers thought of slide resistance (like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan) but they didn't do enough to prevent it.   This radio needs big high-traction rubber pads on the bottom, and then it would be perfect."

It sounds very nice, has plenty of volume, and doesn't seem to mind a little moisture and steam.  I like the features, such as the push buttons (rather than switches or slides).  I've only given it 4 out of 5 stars because every once in a while it sort of cuts out for about 2 seconds, which can be annoying when I'm listening to something important (news, weather), or it crackles and I have to turn it a bit to get good reception once again.

I can't get one of my local tv stations to come in, nor can I get my favorite radio station that's broadcast from 30 or so miles away (I can get it from any other radio).
