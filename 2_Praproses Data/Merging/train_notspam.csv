528304,A1N8OBUE89TAM,0,1,3,B000EPAP1U,1/8/2009,4,0,0,Great value,"Prior to buying this product, we were using 2 different wireless phone systems so we its a pain to transfer calls, maintain phone numbers, caller IDs, etc. We needed to replace it with one phone system that can accommodate at least 4 handsets so 2 years ago we bought the Uniden DCT646-4 expandable wireless set.  Here are my thoughts on this phone: * Setup was not quick as each handset needs to be configured but it was relatively smooth and straightforward.  Once you know how to configure one handset, the rest are mechanical. * I have had handsets with better call quality but also had some that are worse, so this phone is probably average when it comes to call quality.  Its clear enough for me and the person on the other line so it works. * Each handset can be identified by name so I thought that was a nice feature.  If I needed somebody, I know which handset to call/page to get to the right person or room. * The voicemail button setup can be a bit cumbersome when you change providers and voice mail access numbers (like we did) as each handset needs to be configured.  I don't know how many people have different voice mails for the same line but this should have been one global (propagating to all handsets) setup or at least an option to have it configured as such. * The caller ID is useful to screen out callers but unfortunately there is no way to just ignore the call and stop the ringing for all handsets all at once.  You can press ""End"" on one handset but only that one stops ringing.  The rest will keep on ringing until the voicemail system takes over.  This was especially irritating when our youngest was still a baby and we forgot to take the handset out of the room he's sleeping in or when there are visitors in the house.  There should be one button to just ignore the call and send it to the voicemail. All in all, there are things I would want improved on this system but for the price and features this Uniden system is a great value.",0,9094,Uniden,139.99,"Uniden DCT646-4 Digital 2.4 GHz expandable Cordless system, call waiting/ caller ID and accessory handset and charger",Brand->Uniden,BatteriesIncluded->1,Color->silver/ black,Binding->Electronics,EAN->0050633320372,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Uniden,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Uniden,Model->DCT646-4,MPN->DCT646-4,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->Uniden,Feature->2.4 Digital With Caller ID and 4-Handsets,Feature->Integri sound life like audio,Feature->100- number shared caller ID/phonebook memory,Feature->intercom between handsets,Feature->direct link 2 way radio system

528301,AAO5HSYB23WW9,0,0,46,B000EPLRFI,6/2/2006,5,84,87,I love it,"I love it. It is not perfect, but it is close. The black looks great. It is not shiny, but matte. It is not painted on, but infused in poly-whatever material used to make the case. It is durable and buffs clean from fingerprints when needed. The magsafe connector is great. I have damaged other laptops from tripping over the power cord, no more with magsafe. I also love the lack of a latch, as magnets hold the laptop closed--a nice touch. It gets a bit warm, but honestly it doesn't bother me. I prefer that the fans are as quite as they are. It is a trade off, cool computer=loud computer. I prefer a bit warmer and whisper quiet as the MacBook is. What else can I say? It is super fast, it runs OS X and Windows, it has a beautiful screen, and it feels great in my hand, and works perfectly. I can make DVDs that play on my lousy cheap DVD player hooked to my TV (that my PC can't seem to). I think the huge track pad is great. You can use two fingers to scroll thru documents and use two fingers instead of one to right-click. Yes, a Mac laptop that can right click--finally. The only complaint is the speakers are small and not very loud for some things. Without headphones, hearing sound when watching DVDs is hard, since DVDs have a wide sound range, so the lower volume sound, like dialog can be difficult to hear whereas the music and explosions are easier. Even if I turn it up full volume, I cannot hear everything. To make this better, I downloaded the free VLC player for DVDs and media, as it allows me to boost the gain with an equalizer, and be able to hear dialog. iTunes also has an equalizer, so boosting the gain is fine in that program. Upshot, speakers small, not perfect, if a problem, use headphones or software that adds an equalizer. If you want to save money, buy the white one, it is a better deal, and some prefer how it looks. I like the black, so I paid the extra money. Newegg has memory for it, and its cheaper than Apple's by far, and this MacBook is super easy to upgrade memory to 2 gig. I highly recommend more memory if you are a power user.

528300,A2W248L4J2M647,0,0,45,B000EPLRFI,6/1/2006,4,61,69,One of the best bang for your money,"I would rate this 4.5, but there is no option. I do not feel that it deserves 5.0 either due to a few issues. Well, overall impression is very good. Great looking as most Apple's  products. 1""thick and has decent small factor for road warrior. Performance: It is about 2-3 times faster than my old 12.1 G4PB depending on what you run. Everything is very snappy and OS Tiger and iLife'06 work flawlessly. One of the best OS yet. I recommend to reinstall the system. I get around 5GB back by eliminating those programs, etc. that I do not need. Otherwise, it takes around 17GB for complete installation. Quite a lot as it comes straight from factory, me think. Features: Well, here is what MacBook really shines. It comes with all you would ever need at the best price package. Look at specs yourselves and you will understand what I am saying. I would recommend getting aftermarket memory stick (1GB costs around under $90). Even upgrade to 1.25GB, it is really worth it. Unlike old small iBook, MacBook aftermarket do-it-yourselves upgrade is a breeze whether memory or harddisk. What is hot: 1. Built-in iSight is pretty good. Better than my expectation. 2. Very nice responsive keyboard and trackpad. You might need to adjust your trackpad response per your personal preference. 3. Keyboard at first look seems unusual, but after a few hours, it think that it does stand out from usual crowd. 4. Nice wireless iDVD remote. 5. Subtle glossy screen, delivers awesome picture quality, while dose not produce too much glare while you are outdoor. 6. Magsafe is one great addition. Very well thought out and design indeed. What is not: 1. Heat is way beyond my liking. However, it is only at top left of the laptop bottom, where you connect power supply (Magsafe). It is not just warm at that spot, it is blistering hot. This is very imminent when using AC regardless of power setting. While on battery at battery saver mode, it does cool down and only gets warm. I highly suggest that you get cooling pad to max out longevity of your precious lappy. 2. Small lappy factor is not that great. Well it is a tad lighter than MBP by about 0.4lb. 5.2lb is pushing for most true road warriors. Considering many other goodies you will be carrying in your bag. The old small Mac lappies weigh around 4.2-4.6lb only. Bottomline: If you want the hottest lappy in the market now, go get it. If you think that you can wait, you might want to wait toward the end of the year. I am being hopeful to see MBP in 12 or 13"" or Apple improves heat problem for all their new laptops.

And it is great thing that apple  cares for customers than anything else!!!!!!!!!!!

In practice it never happens and can you imagine how much time you get the battery when you are using it for regular netsurfing?...........................................Belive me its  typically around 2 hrs!!

528243,A3HAOIT3XS3TIL,0,1,16,B000EQKXFM,5/12/2006,4,30,30,Pleasantly surprised!,"I received the iHome iH5 for Christmas, but returned it because one of the speakers buzzed.  I didn't replace it because of reports of this problem recurring.  I decided I didn't need an FM/AM Radio w/ iPod dock after all.  Until I ran across the TEAC GR-10i at Costco.  I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a tray after receiving a coupon. At first, I was worried about its larger size, but I find that its size probably contributets to its bigger sound - far superior to the iHome; probably on par with speakers that cost 2 to 3 times as much.  I just can't believe this unit produces such rich (with deep bass) sound.  The AM and FM reception is also very good - I can receive all my favorites quite clearly, where usually I have to settle for half of them (with static!).  And it comes with a seemingly sturdy remote (weighs twice as much as you'd expect, and the material feel strong). My only complaints are its size, the gray color, and lack of battery backup (power failures >30 sec resets everything, according to the manual).  Its performance ranks a 5; its cosmetics and lack of a few features ranks a 4.  Other problems for other folks are the lack of a full complement of alarm clock features (such as snooze!) and docking plates for the newest iPods (video and nano). Bottom line is if you want great AM/FM reception and the ability to listen your iPod through the dedicated port (or any other source via its aux input located in the front), then this is hands-down the winner (certainly over the iHome).",0,12585,TEAC,99.99,TEAC Hi-Fidelity Table Radio,EAN->0043774021246,BatteriesIncluded->0,Feature->iPod Dock (iPod charges while playing),Brand->TEAC,Feature->Digital AM/FM Tuner with 20 Station Presets,Manufacturer->TEAC,Model->GR-10i,MPN->GR-10i,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->TEAC,Studio->TEAC,Title->TEAC Hi-Fidelity Table Radio,UPC->043774021246,,,Feature->Tuned-Port Speakers for Hi-Fi Stereo Sound,Feature->Large LCD with Dimmer,Feature->Remote Control Included,Label->TEAC,ListPrice

528220,A1FMDVOJBAISVM,0,1,8,B000EQXY1C,5/17/2006,2,71,72,Developer take note: can't produce real blueprints!,"I have long been a fan of 3D Home Architect and have used my old version to design a dozen units of housing, usually on my own but with a professional architect's assistance on a few. This month I sat down to redesign my kitchen and, seeing that the copyright date on my old software (version 3) was 1999, was inspired to try out the newly released 3D HDS8.  My experience with the new product has been frustrating, disappointing, and time-consuming. I feel sympathy for the software developers:  they have clearly worked very hard to add a lot of features, and have increased the ""power"" of this tool to enable the user to make it ""do what I mean"".  To their credit, the limitations of version 3 have pretty much been eliminated:  if you have the patience you can model virtually any 3D object within the design space.  However, their marketing bosses have castrated the end result:  sure it's fun to play with a eunuch, but what's the point if it can't generate offspring? It seems that this product has been demoted from top-of-the-line to a second tier.  It seems that if you want the fully-enabled progeny of this software development team, you will have to fork over $600 for a big-brother product that is marketed through different channels under a different name.  My sympathy for the developers:  their reputation will be dependent on consumer reaction to this mainstream product. The good news: what you get with this product is essentially a designer's ""video game"" that allows you to create beautiful on-screen images.  There are a number of ways to render your product on screen, most of which were present in version 3 but there are some extensions to these features that make version 8 superior. The bad news:  once you've taken the time to create a perfect on-screen rendition of your project (a major time sink, it's as addicting as a video game--with every feature including the kitchen sink thrown in, the temptation to add detail is irresistable), there is no way to ""create blueprint-style plans to print or email"" as promised on the product's box.  Also, code bloat has slowed everything down: version 3 worked well on a Pentium 600MHz with 256Mb, version 8 requires a computer that hasn't been invented yet. Two of my favorite features of version 3 have been ripped out:  the ability to darken wall lines when printing, and the ability to view horizontal cross sections in 3D view (the latter is replaced by a whiz-bang but useless 2D vertical section view).  This product gives you no printing options whatsoever; all you can do is print whatever's on the screen in 150, 300 or 600 dpi. Without the ability to print, I can't use this product to communicate anything other than fancy 3D pictures of the interior. Unfortunately, I can't revert to version 3 either:  there is no import/export utility for data files.  So I will have to find another program for future products, this one isn't what I was hoping for. Developers, take note:  in version 9, PLEASE add real blueprint printing capability.  I need to take these drawings down to the city building department once in a while.  The ones I got in version 3 were amateurish but serviceable.

With the hundred dollar plus rebates on the hardware, as well as substantial discounts on the service, I thought I'd break down and give it a try.  Here' my experience... The Good... 1. Very intuitive user interface for the set-up screens and remote; it could be argued that Tivo is the gold standard for ease of use 2. Very secure packaging of unit 3. Included cabling is of unusally high quality (not Monster cable grade, but still very good for included cabling) 4. Installation directions are very easy to follow (though not as good as Dell's color coded design) 5. There is a 30 day money back guarantee 6. Customer reps are friendly and well trained (and they speak english too!) The Bad... 1. The front of the box says all required cables are included; the directions state that a second A/V cable -- required for the recommended installation method -- is ""user provided"" (i.e., sold separately) 2. The service is not compatible with some VoIP services 3. Though set-up is easy, it is a one to two hour ordeal, requiring multiple visits to websites and countless button presses to ensure interoperablity with the cable box 4. The remote is pretty low tech looking; it also has a lower quality feel tha leads me to belive that I'll be shopping for a replacement in a year or less The Ugly... 1.

Unfortunately, Tivo's idea of ""dual tuner"" is really only designed for use with basic cable.  I have digital cable, but I can also just watch the analog signal on TVs with no cable box.  In my area, the basic cable signal is weak and has some static so I prefer to watch the digital signal, but I expect to be able to record either.

528013,A3IVN2U8TYSIDX,0,0,81,B000ET5W6E,8/23/2006,5,78,78,Excellent - very happy,"After reading reviews here I hesitated but happened to see the same machine (but without duplex capability) at a work site and that clinched it for me. This machine is FAST. Setup is easy (I used the network connection) and the software is vastly improved over the last Brother laser I had (an HL-1270N). The ticking noises other reviews mention is very slight and lasts just a few seconds while it heats up. Previous lasers I've had would typically whir loudly during this warm-up time - not this one. I sit next to the printer and it's really nothing. I think people have noticed it because it occurs in silence without other whiring sounds. The noise of the paper pick up (which is typical of any laser printer) is louder than the ticking (heating) sounds and the ticking stops before the first page comes out (so it lasts mere seconds). 5 seconds ticking, 5 seconds whiring and printing, page comes out. Followed by maybe 20-30 very small ticks over the next few minutes as it cools down. In comparison, my QMS color laser whirs loudly for about 15 minutes after printing a page. What I didn't appreciate before ordering is that even the scanner has duplexing capability - fantastic! Double sided faxes and scans are simple. Scanning works well both from the printer and when controlled from the PC. From the printer it shows the list of the available networked PC names to scan to - very nice. Pick your machine, press start, job done. The only slight quirk I've noticed so far is that when sending double sided faxes the reverse sides are transmitted upside down. Maybe there's a setting for this somewhere. I haven't needed to read the manual AT ALL so far. I haven't seen any sign of flickering room lights or other concerns from the power draw during heat-up. Installation couldn't have been simpler. Machine is not too heavy and is easily picked up and moved by one person. OCR software works very well - again an improvement on the past. Verdict (after owning a few days): Don't hesistate to buy - so far very very happy.

To begin with, this machine's specs are top notch for the money.  You simply cannot get this much bang for your buck from any other company.  Taking the machine out of the box and setting it up was remarkably easy.  I actually thought I was forgeting something.  The software installed cleanly and is user-friendly.  I should mention, however, that I have not gone through the fax machine setup (not using for that purpose at the present time).  Also, the machine does not come with a USB cable, which is, unfortunately, fairly standard with printers today. Prints and copies at 30 ppm in 600 dpi.  I have tested this and it appears fairly close to true (maybe a little slower, like 28 ppm).  It produces nice, crisp clear letters in both print and copy modes.  The 50 page ADF is made from a reasonably sturdy plastic.  At least it doesn't feel like it is going to come loose or break off, and I have not had any paper jams (as of yet) in the ADF or standard, 250 count paper tray. The scan function has worked well.  Two very nice features this model provides are scan to pdf file and scan to OCR.  The scan to pdf file is a rare option in a desktop multi-function machine at this price.  It works well, although I am still playing around with the settings in an effort to find the best scan quality at a decent file size.  I think the pdf file sizes I have been getting are too large (around 700KB - 1MB for a 1 to 2 page pdf).  Surely this can be corrected by changing some settings.  The scan to OCR also works remarkably well.  I can remember 5 years ago attempting to use scan to OCR on another machine and being very disappointed.  Things have improved greatly. The cost of the toner cartridges on this model are reasonable.  A high yield 7000 page cartridge for around $80 - $90 works out to a cost per page of 1.14 - 1.28 cents per page of toner, which is quite good. Can't comment on the fax functions b/c I am not using it for that purpose. Overall, a very nice machine with impressive features at this price.

527930,A36XRGX51WTMWS,0,0,804,B000ETVKHE,4/22/2006,5,523,534,A Solid alternative to Ipod Nano,"This player is really well thought out. I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about an Ipod nano. The included software is complete and works flawlessly. Best of all, it will play WMA music files, has an included FM radio, has an expansion slot, and plays home videos. Here's what I've learned so far: 1. MUSIC- You can drag and drop from windows explorer or you can use Windows Media Player 10. Your choice. Either way works great. Note: The installation CD does not include WMP 10 but no big deal. 2. PHOTOS- The included media app on the install CD is a wonder to behold. It couldn't be easier to use and is rock solid stable. Photos shot horizontally are cropped (like widescreen) but photos that are vertical are shown full screen. I am going to experiment on this but haven't had time just yet since I just bought the Sansa. 3. VIDEO- Probably the best feature. The same media app that you use for photos also doubles for videos. Again, unlike some other players that have problems with converting video, this is heaven sent. Just pick out a video and press convert. It converts and then transfers in one step. It works perfectly. Unlike past Sansa's you have to spend extra for a decent carrying case. Still, if you like felt pouches and lanyards (I Don't), they come included. One minor drawback is that you can only charge using the USB attached to the computer. An AC adapter would have been nice. One final note. I tried to convert 2 DVD movies that were already on my hard drive. They were in the 550-700mb range. Each time, the video utility started to convert them no problem. However, in each case the utility timed out after 13 minutes 39 seconds. It cancelled the whole thing so not to worry about having 1/2 a movie on your sansa. I am going to fool around with this and see if I can shrink the file size of those 2 movies to around 200-300mb and try again. If I can work around this and am sucessful I'll let you know. Even though trying to watch a feature length movie on a 1.8 inch screen might be a bit much, the screen itself is really crystal clear (better than nano) and TFT not STN. I would highly recommend this player to anyone.

527925,A22YLSO32ELPCZ,0,0,799,B000ETVKHE,8/18/2006,5,63,65,"Tried it, love it!!!","Some of the reviews I read left me wondering if this was the right player for me.  I found a consumer review on-line where they ran through the features and actually demonstrated how the thing works.  That did it for me.  After that, I knew that I had to have it. I haven't had to be concerned with the technical issues, as it has done everything except convert video clips that I have taken with my camera.  I found some other software that will convert it and allow me to load it onto the player. Here's why I gave it a five: 1. Voice recording - I use the voice recording to record meetings at work.  The sound is crystal clear, better than any tape recorder I have used in the past.  Also, using the lanyard and dropping it down the front of my shirt, nobody else realizes that the meetings are being recorded.  It's a great opportunity for black mail! 2. I was looking for something that would allow me to record radio broadcasts - I've tried it with music and it sounds every bit as good as the station did the first time.  I mostly use it for talk radio and it works great.  Radio reception is awesome.  I record the radio at work in an office setting.  Reception is even passable in the elevator! 3. MP3s - I am very pleased here.  I was worried that play-lists would be a problem and that having the player randomly select music would also be a problem.  That was based on other reviews that I saw here.  I am sorry, but those people must be idiots.  You can upload the music using Windows Media Player, dragging and dropping play-lists.  The player keeps the play-list and automatically groups your music.  You can select the play-list and it will shuffle just that play-list (if you activate the shuffle function).  You can also play music by song, album, artist, and genre.  Or you can play them all.  It's all very simple and works well. 4. Pictures - I am a photo-nut.  I love to take pictures of my kids, landscapes, and sunsets.  The photos are pretty small, but the detail that the screen allows makes the images very sharp.  You can definitely fit more pictures in here than you ever could in your wallet.  The photos are all converted to *.bmp files using the software that came with the player, but it is very easy to add photos.  You have to rotate all of your photos so they are taller rather than wider to maximize the size of the image on the screen, but it is not difficult at all. 5. Memory - I have uploaded 100s of songs, a handful of short video clips and commercials I found online, 147 photos, and a handful of recordings.   I have used just over half of the memory on this thing. Here are things that I wish you could do with it: 1. Switch out the battery - sure you can, but you need to buy another special battery and I have not seen an external charger.  This is a relatively minor thing.  It will last a full day (from sunrise past sunset) and recharges in about an hour.  It has not been a big drawback for me. 2. Delete songs directly off the player without hooking up to your computer - I ended up with a number of albums of my daughter's intermingled with my music and had to keep fast-forwarding over those songs.  They were mixed in with my work music, so I had to tolerate it for a full day.  Again, not a huge issue. 3. Despite the fact that I have been very careful with the player, it does have some small scratches on its front, one of them on the display.  I can't imagine that this isn't a problem with other players too.  Again, it's not the end of the world. Things that I was surprised by: 1. There's a record button on the side.  That makes it easy to record radio programs when you are taken away from listening unexpectedly. 2. Play-lists are easy to create. 3. It is easy to set the player to shuffle and/or repeat 4. The size is really much smaller than it appears in photos 5. The sound quality when recording (voice and radio) 6. You can reset the player by merely holding down the power button for about a minute.  I did have it lock up on me when I was getting ready to record a meeting, but figured that out just in time. All and all, I would say this is a wonderful player and would (and have) highly recommended it to my friends.  I hope this helps sway you to make the purchase.  I was having second thoughts when I read some of these reviews, but those must have been posted by idiots.

I searched and read reviews for 3 months about all the different players available. A friend bought a Nano for Christmas and I was impressed but like I said I am not an Apple fan. So finally I had just decided to give in and buy a Nano. I had given up trying to find a better alternative or even one that was close. But to my surprise I read a last minute review of the SanDisk Sansa e260. It sounded great but would it really compare? Believe me, it does!!! It offers more than I ever would have guessed. It comes with a built in FM tuner so you don't have extra attachments and costs associated with it. I don't know how much I will use it but it is a nice ""free"" feature. The audio player is excellent and has 8 preset EQ's. The video is great and also the Pics but I bought it primarily as an MP3 player. The screen is amazingly clear and bright. Much better than the Nano. That brings me to the real selling point for me. You can use the included software to manage your music or you can use Windows Media Player but the beautiful this about this player is you can connect to your PC\Laptop as a usb drive. Since I already have about 20 GB of music on my Laptop converted and normalized. All I have to do is drag and drop the music I want to Sansa drive and media folder. The transfer for a standard CD is about 10 seconds. So far I haven't found anything that didn't play on the Sansa. The other two big selling points for me are a removable\replacable battery and an memory expansion slot. Both are long overdue by other manufacturers. The Sansa takes a about 4 seconds to load but it isn't an issue for me especially when it help preserve battery life. This is a great alternative to the IPOD. In someways, it is superior. Battery life (compared with my pals Nano), screen clarity, Expansion slot, USB drive mode, Built in Voice recorder and FM tuner.

It is way too easy to lose your place in a book with this device. If you forget to lock the controls and you bump the record button on the left side of the device--you've lost your place.  If you connect to your PC to charge the device or download another book, you've lost your place.  If you accidentally push the center control to the left or the right, you've gone to the beginning of this section or to the beginning of the next section and lost your place. I've gotten into the habit of looking to see what section I'm on frequently so I have a clue when I have to start searching for my place. Also, on 3 occasions since January, I've gotten the message ""Synchronize to continue music subscription.""  The book I was listening to wouldn't play at all. This didn't have anything to do with the book checkout period expiring. The SanDisk help desk people had me reformat the memory and re-transfer the file.  It was the same file, but it worked after reformatting.  Don't see how that could be a problem with the file, but that's what the SanDisk people were saying. It happened on especially long books, like ""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell."" I recommend getting the Macally SN-A411 USB AC charger so you can recharge without losing your place in your audio book.  I'm on my second charger (replaced by Macally) as the first one quit working after 3 months.  The only cost to me was shipping the old one back to them.

527893,A3827OGYO6Z67K,0,1,767,B000ETVKHE,3/2/2007,4,7,7,Definitely A Worthy iPod Nano Competitor,"I had been using an iRiver h10 for a little under a year and it died a horrible firmware death that was unrepairable, so I got this unit as its replacement. Let's clear up one thing up front:  THIS UNIT DOES NOT SUPPORT MP3's ABOVE 256KBPS.  SanDisk does not acknowledge this or post this as a part of the product, but their tech support will admit it if you call them about it.  The 256kbps cap isn't  asuggestion -- the unit will choke and stutter badly on anything higher bitrate.  So just know that ahead of time that you'll have to convert your MP3's down to 256kbps at least before you can use them on it, and plan accoridngly.  For me it was an annoying oversight (especially since my old iRiver H10 happily played 320kbps files), but not a really big deal because with a half-hour of work I could convert my 320kbps files down to 256kbps and transfer them over for use. All that aside, it's a great little player with a very nice display for its size and value.  The sound is good, controls and UI are solid, and the battery life is fanatstic (2 more hours batt. life than a Nano).  Its 4GB of storage is a solid capacity and value. The playlist plays through a number randomize function, which is a GOOD thing.  Each song is assigned a number, and when a randome number is chosen the corresponding song plays.  This is nice for one reason -- if you change the contents of the drive while it's paused, the device won't choke when it tries to resume a file that's no longer there.  Instead it will play whatever file has that same number now, or skip ahead to a new number if that number simply no longer exists.  It's a very small thing in the grand scheme of things, but a big annoyance that it prevents and I've seen other players not be abel to handle such a simple scenario. One other downside I found was the media conversion tool to import photos and video (since this unit plays video).  On the video side it unfortunately converts to QuickTime, which is IMHO an absolutely terrible video format that results in bloated movie size on the device (80 MB video files become ~160 MB after conversion).  However it converted over my little DivX movies with almost no hitch.  And the screen is small for video, but not entirely unwatchable.  I personally still find it more novelty than useful though, but it deifnitely works as well as it can. On top of it all, it also offers MicroSD expansion, and a rather nice FM Tuner -- neither of which an iPod can boast. So if you don't want to be an iSheep, and you don't need iTunes or similar music management software to help manage your device and are happy with Windows Explorer copy-n-paste to move your media on, this really is a very nice little player for its price.  I have to say I enjoy it a lot and would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone specifically trying to avoid Apple's iPod empire.

I like some of the features like loading mp3s from computer. You dont have to go through format change, you can simply drag and drop as in Windows Explorer, FM radio is fairly good and ability to store and display color pictures.

Several reviews below gave a low rating to the player's sound fidelity, but it sounds clear and rich to me on voice or music.  My main for purpose for using it  is voice Podcasts.  I have been using my player for about three weeks. There are two volume levels in the Settings.  The highest volume in the default or low setting is not very high.  This means any background noise can easily overshadow what is playing.  Changing to the higher level is a distinct help when walking along the street or listening on an airliner. Several previous reviewers also complained about short battery life.  The AAA alkaline battery that came with the unit gave out before its listed time, but it may have been weak from sitting on a shelf.  The battery meter in the display does not give any reliable clue as to when the battery will fail.  Always carry a spare battery with you, especially if you are using rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise, it seems to be a great little unit and I am looking forward to getting a lot of use from it. The player is easy to use without installing the factory software.  As long as ""MTP"" shows on the screen when connected by cable to the computer, just drag and drop files.  It does not matter if files are in a folder or not.  The player finds and plays them in alphabetical order.  If properly shut down, it remembers where you stopped and begins there the next time the player is used.  It will even save your place during a reasonably quick battery change.  When a battery fails, the player starts again at the beginning of the file playing when the battery failed. The PDF manual on the software disc is far more detailed than the printed quick start guide and is worth reading soon after your purchase. It is not difficult to navigate the menu, but a little practice makes use of the controls much easier.  The FM radio feature is nice to have. The voice recorder works well.  Files are stored in the Record folder in the unit's memory.  You are supposed to be able to play them on the player, but I had to move them to my computer first.  The files appear with a WAV extension on the player, but appear on the computer as MP3 files.    The microphone does not produce a loud recording and must be held close to the mouth, making it easy to get a lisp on the recording.

Storage size is a good size to have enough variety of music. 4.  Price was more than reasonable. 5.  The unit runs on a battery so a battery change would only be necessary versus charging it. In addition, I learned that this unit could carry photos and videos.  While unlikely to ever be used, it's there as an option. Like other SanDisk products, this item does deliver on what it advertises to be.  The instructions for how to upload music is a bit confusing, but solved with the following:  I opened the unit as though it were a regular flash drive.  Thereafter, I opened the ""Media"" folder and clicked and dragged the music I wanted into the folder.  Simple enough. The sound quality is fine (i.e., equalizer options) and the bright color screen allows for easy reading.  In addition, there is the option to listen to the radio if so desired.

One, my son had a similar, smaller version that he was very happy with. Second, I wanted a small flash player device that would work with Rhapsody and their Rhapsody to go service. Initially the player performed well. I was syncing about 90 songs which consisted of subscription and MP3s from my own CD collection. After I added a second playlist which was mostly subscription music, the player froze up. At first, I thought I had tried to sync too much music, but I was well under the 1 gig limit at 650 meg. So, I started doing all the usual things to reset the device (pop the battery, hit different control key combinations, etc.). But everytime I turned it on, it froze on the Sandisk screen which is the initial screen. After 1.5 weeks of working with Sandisk support, they decided to have me ship it back and they would send a new unit. The new unit arrived and things worked well for one day then the unit started to stop playing after each song and freeze. Popping the battery would unfreeze this time and I was able to follow technical support instructions by reformatting the device using Windows Media player and resyncing with Rhapsody. After the resync, the device froze again and now I cannot reset. I suspect that the problem has something to do with the Rhapsody service and the ""Play for Sure"" code, but that is only speculation. If I can't get my money back, I will try to get another unit and only sync it with MP3s.

This is a very user-friendly MP3 player, probably a good start for first timer.

I have yet to fill the player, and so far I have 198 songs loaded (MP3 files, about 3-4 minutes in legnth).  I know if the files are WMA files, the player will hold double the songs.  There is also an FM radio on the player, which is a nice addition. I have yet to experience any glitches with the player.  It plays my songs beautifully and the volume is MUCH more than I need, unless I want to rupture my ear drums.  There are two settings to the volume, one louder than the first, and I still have it on the first setting.  I also bought a $7 set of little speakers, and it sounds awesome! The picture viewing capabilty is something I have no explored.  But it seems a tad pointless to me.  The screen is tiny!  I don't think you could even see what the picture was...

Some of the issues in other reviews here can be solved by reading the manual. Simply set to MSC mode and the player acts just like a removeable hard drive when connected via USB. Very simple to transfer or delete songs etc. The 2Gb is reasonably good capacity... in fact, great capacity considering the price. The FM radio works fine, although a little trickier to navigate than some older sandisk models. Color screen is good, although a little too small to be practicable to view photos on. The song title can also take a little too long to scroll fully. I had no trouble with sound quality or crackling or clipping at start of song. Sound quality is fine! Battery life also seems good for me. I have even ran some el cheapo batteries with it and had good life up to the stated specs (although this depends on how much you press buttons and have the screen lit up). Voice recorder is handy, although I find I don't use it too much, your mileage may vary though. As a basic MP3 player and radio, I find it hard to beat given the price tag. I have no issues with size of the unit. Sure its not as thin as an Ipod Nano, but it takes one AAA battery which you can get anywhere. No need to have a power point to recharge.

526758,A3GTU3AY1YLLMS,0,0,78,B000EY1LCI,10/4/2006,5,23,23,Excellent travel day pack for the photo-tourist,"I bought this pack to use primarily when travelling. When I'm on vacation, I don't want to be loaded with so much gear that I'm more caught up in my equipment than my surroundings. However, I still want to be able to carry my Nikon D50; 18-70mm, 10-20mm, speedlight, 90mm macro, perhaps another lens or two, a travel tripod, a jacket, snacks, and still have room to cram in a couple of small souveniers. And while I typically leave the laptop back at the hotel, I want to have it and my camera gear with me on a plane. In addition, it has to be able to carry a fair amount of weight comfortably for a long time and be built to last. Overall, this bag meets all those criterea. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable this bag is when fully loaded. It does not have a hip belt, but the design of bag places most of the weight (the camera gear) at the bottom and near your back (the laptop). The straps are fairly wide and excellently padded and the back pads allow a reasonable amount of airflow and support (thanks to a generously cushioned and contoured lumbar pad). It's sturdy enough for regular use while traveling, but you still want to excercise care handling the bag as all the camera gear sits at the bottom. I wouldn't trust it with the trained gorillas I've watched unload baggage and you don't want to drop it, but otherwise I don't worry about my gear inside it. If possible, I would give the bag 4 1/2 stars; overall, it's a great solution to my needs, but it has a couple of minor short-comings. While it sounds minor, the one that bothers me the most is the single zipper on the main compartment. I really like the double zips on the camera case and laptop portions as they can be left closed in the center for rapid access, but that's not an option for the main compartment. I frequently find myself opening the laptop area when intending to get in the main compartment. And with a double zip, it would be possible to allow a tall narrow object (like a tripod) to protrude out the top. In addition, I'd like a little more space in the main compartment - it's a tight fit for my 14"" tripod. Other items on my wish list would be a water-bottle holder, or, better yet, some loops on the outside that you could attach other items to. Despite my minor gripes, it's obvious there was a lot of attention to detail and the pack is well engineered. When opening the camera compartment with the bag on the ground, the top portion tilts back as if hinged to allow easy access to your gear. There is room for even a large 17"" laptop (Dell Latitude D810 - 14.25"" x 10.5"" x 1.75""). The front mp3 pocket is lined with soft cloth that won't scratch you ipod (or sunglasses) and there are good organizational features in the main compartment: couple zippered pockets, pen pockets, a key clip, etc. And all this is in an understated package that doesn't broadcast it may contain several thousand dollars worth of equipment inside - it just looks like a daypack.

In the past I've had a tough time getting good prints from them from regular photo labs, and pro printers cost too much. I have experience with an older Nikon slide scanner, and I am getting much better results from the Epson V700 bed scanner. I see image improvements to 6400dpi, I scan to tiff at 48bit using the Epson software, then adjust color and contrast in photoshop cs2. I get very good results even from some warped slides where I always had focus problems when printed in the lab. Its very exciting to see these pictures again. Despite good reviews of this feature, I have yet to find an acceptable result from the included automatic dust removal, both hardware and software based. The dust is gone, replaced by strange pixelation. Much better to remove the dust by hand using the CS2 repair tool, which works like magic for me. After dust removal I increase sharpness using smart sharpening, and save to jpg. Its amazing the detail that emerges with a little sharpening. Resultant jpg is 20-35megs, but is compatible with local printer's fuji frontier printer. With the control I get from manipulating and color-converting the digital image, I get prints that come out exactly as I like, better than any  enlarger-based print I've ever obtained. I won't claim the v700 will scan better than a modern slide scanner because I've never used one, but the results I get are certainly better than I expected. It is surprising to me that these slide prints are on par with what I get from my nikon d70. Bed scanning of slides is pretty fast, about 45 minutes to scan 12 slides when scanning to my pentium m laptop. It take about a minute to put the old slides away and plop new ones into the holder. Installation was super easy. Just install driver, plug in, start scanning. But the documentation isn't so good. There is a lot involved in getting a good scan, its sort of an art. You'll need to read a bunch on the internet. When you first get the printer, play with all the settings, scan the same slide over and over with different slide-height settings, resolutions,etc, until you find what works for you. Have an idea what you want to see, then try stuff and see if you can make it happen. Like I said above, the auto dust removal might be convenient, but the results won't withstand close scrutiny. Ditto for the scanning software based ""color restoration"", ""sharpening"", or anything else. Just post-process the 48bit tiff in photoshop. I played around with the included silverfast SE scanning software, but found the interface clunky and there was no functional improvement over the included epson software, so I don't use it. The included detailed scan manipulation functions are all available in photoshop, so I don't bother. When scanning photos (as opposed to film or slides), the resolution makes a huge difference. Some resultions will alias the print pattern.

We bought this scanner to use mainly for scanning medium format film. The scanner resolution is excellent, and the ability to scan in 16 bit mode provides extended dynamic range and ability to capture subtle tone details. However, achieveing this always requires changing the default exposure levels, particularly on the low end of the scale. A limitation of the software, however, is that the histogram tool for setting the levels always shows the scale in a linear 8 bit mode (0 to 255 levels), whereas a log scale or optical density scale would probably be more appropriate for 16 bit scans. Photshop also does not have this feature but would benefit from it. A more troubling problem we have experienced is that all our film scans require changing the gamma of the blue channel significantly in order to achieve color balance. Once we had that figured out, the results have been excellent. The software documentation is pretty lame, as usual. As far as film handling goes, the slide holders seem adequate, but the film holders feel like they are going to break every time you use them. The medium format holder only holds the film by the long edges, which doesn't provide much support. One solution for this would be to improvise a filmholder which is like an enlarger holder in that it clamps the film on opposite sides of the image. The Epson filmholders have holes in them that the scanner uses to detect the holder type, and the software does a good job of detecting the borders of each image and presenting them all to you in the preview window. Despite these nit-picks, this scanner is an excellent value. The scans we are getting off of Fuji Velvia 100 are breathtaking. I hope that the availability of these will renew interest in medium and large format film, as these offer creative options which are impossible with digital cameras.",0,8034,Epson,0.0,Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner,EAN->0010343856899,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Groundbreaking 6400 DPI resolution, achieved by Epson's Dual Lens System",Brand->Epson,Feature->4.0 Dmax for fine shadow detail,Label->Epson,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

526670,A2UKH0INAIGEWN,0,0,53,B000EZY19W,5/12/2007,5,40,41,Highly Satisfied with the Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner,"I am highly satisfied with this product.  Scanning photos for me is a means to an end.  The goal is to share web-based images and pleasing prints, occasionally as large as 8.5"" X 11."" Prior to purchase, I researched extensively what I would need to digitize a large quantity of mostly personal photos - both those existing and any future pix I may take with my film equipment.  Since the majority of the photos are 35mm slides and negatives, my initial inclination was a Nikon Coolscan film scanner.  This was further reinforced by having been a Nikon user since the Nikon F days.  Two factors, however, steered me in the flatbed scanner direction. Studying reviews, both from sources such as Amazon's Customer Reviews and from other web sources convinced me that the Epson V700 would meet my needs from a scan-quality standpoint.  And, a closer look at my photo collection revealed that there were numerous prints without corresponding 35mm negatives and a surprising number of medium format negatives, too.  I felt it would be nice to digitize these, as well as the 35mm transparent material, but no film scanner could accommodate them all. I purchased the V700 scanner through Amazon with expedited shipping.  That went smoothly, as did the Epson set up. The V700's graphical user interface is straightforward.  Now, I have used for the last 5 years or so an Epson scanner in my business (embroidery design).  While that scanner is much more basic in functionality, my previous experience gives the V700's user interface a comfortable, familiar feel. I only installed the Epson Scanning Driver Software and the User Guide.  I use Adobe Elements 5.0 for any enhancement and cleanup that may be necessary. I scan in Professional Mode, and most always turn off all Epson features. This has to be verified each time, by the way, since they have an annoying habit of mysteriously turning themselves back on.  I could probably correct this, but haven't taken the time to delve into it since it's so easy to fix on the spot.  I've developed recipes for handling the varied media I scan. I put together a kit for film cleanup/preparation.  It includes PEC-12 solution, PEC Wipes, a soft brush, cotton gloves, a can of compressed air left over from my old darkroom days, a bulb blower (aka ear syringe), a soft brush and cotton swabs.  This kit, in combination with an antistatic plastic dustcover sized for flatbed scanners, has taken care of things so far.  (Where real damage has to be dealt with, the restorative functionality of Elements 5.0 must be utilized.) In addition to handling satisfactorily my scanning requirements, I like the way the V700 sits on my desk.  When not in use, if a stray document or two is placed on it temporarily, no harm is done.  It has its own on/off button conveniently located in front, which permits powering up my computer with or without powering up the scanner.   The V700 simply fits into what I do and want to do.  I am pleased with it.",0,8034,Epson,0.0,Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner,EAN->0010343856899,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Groundbreaking 6400 DPI resolution, achieved by Epson's Dual Lens System",Brand->Epson,Feature->4.0 Dmax for fine shadow detail,Label->Epson,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

526652,AWM2XN8BG9DTZ,0,0,35,B000EZY19W,5/21/2009,5,4,4,Very Nice Product - Totally Met Expectations,"Let me say up front that, because the V700 ships with a SilverFast image management program, this is essentially a joint review of device and software. We're a family of photographers with a lot of legacy negatives and slide material, some ours, some inherited from our parents. We've tried several scanners, with so-so results, and found them slow and somewhat clunky to use. Which meant we made little headway with the huge quantity of material we were trying to get into digital format. The reviews convinced us to try the V700, and we've been delighted. First, I won't say it's perfect - at this price point, we didn't expect to have a totally professional experience. If it were possible, we'd probably give it a 4.5 instead of a 5. Some of the glitches noted by others can be at least mildly irritating. Still, even with the basic SilverFast software shipped with it, it works much better than anything else we've tried. (And using the SilverFast Studio Ai with ME makes it even better - you have to order this separately, but you can get it as a download.) When used with the shipped SilverFast program, the device is intuitive, which results in a fast learning curve. (The videos on the SilverFast support site are extremely helpful should a question arise.) What has impressed us the most is the adjustability of the import controls, especially the ability to adjust F-stops 3 up or down on negative imports, which literally brings most heretofore unviable negative images ""back from the dead."" As to transparencies, the adjustments provided for their import are also helpful. If you combine this adjustment capability with Photoshop controls, it is truly amazing how much life you can return to images so faded or discolored that they're almost invisible to the naked eye. Evidently there's a lot more information left on even the worst of old slides and negatives than our cursory examination led us to believe. Also, we like the speed. The scan process is reasonable as to time required. Also, the ability to scan multiple images at once is cool. Which reminds me of the plastic holder issue. The V700 ships with a good assortment of sizes. Still, it would have been nice to have been offered the option of purchasing spares with the scanner at perhaps somewhat less than the rather breathtaking price charged by after-market vendors like SilverFast. As to ICE, unlike the experience of other reviewers, we definitely notice a difference when using ICE, especially on images with large areas of solid color. If you want to use ICE, do go through the steps of specifying exactly how you want to use it, as this very much affects not only speed but also the end output. The degree of detection and correction sensitivity that you set is critical. If you set the sensitivity high, you can get rid of just about any dust, etc., but the tradeoff for this much ""cleaning up"" is a significant degree of image softening. A setting somewhere in the middle seems to work best. We don't use ICE for closeup people images, instead doing any cleanup in Photoshop. Also, at least in our opinion, we would not use ICE to clean up material that is going to be reproduced in print form. There's more one could say, but I think the above is what we've observed from our experience that would matter to most users. In summation, we really like this product and recommend it.",0,8034,Epson,0.0,Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner,EAN->0010343856899,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Groundbreaking 6400 DPI resolution, achieved by Epson's Dual Lens System",Brand->Epson,Feature->4.0 Dmax for fine shadow detail,Label->Epson,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

For serious photographers.","My father in law, who has been scanning in thousands of slides, negatives and photos going back at least 60 years brought samples of every kind of photographic data to my house to test out this scanner. In the past I have scanned in many, many 35mm with a Canonscan 9950F. This scanner needed more stringent evaluation, it is obviously a powerhouse designed for serious users. We set up on DELL XPS 600 with Windows XP. Hardware setup easy, even for beginners.  Someone with experience would not even need directions. Tried the scanner with 35mm slides,  35mm  negatives, black and white color photos of different levels of quality.  It worked well with all of them and was able to restore poor quality photos automatically. He had some slides that are in 7mm square cardboard frames (Ektacrome) takes more creativity to fit into the holders and has to be sort of kludged together.  Those of us with some really old photographic material would appreciate the flexibility to perhaps purchase other holders for stranger sizes.  Understandably, they would not be included since most people would not need them. Color restoration on AutoScan was ok, but not Photoshop quality. Professional mode has many good choices of setting and produced superb results. Digital Ice works well to remove dust. We could not figure out how to do multiple scans in professional mode.  This may be due to the designers figuring that if you are using professional mode that you want to tweak the inputs yourself.  Went to create new field for storage and everything disappeared and had to spend time figuring out where the scan was sent. It is an excellent idea that that transparency feature is built into the machine. Top does not flop down easily, might not seem like a big deal but makes the media much easier to load when you don't have to hold up the top with one hand.  Scanning multiple pages to pdf is great and very functional.  The computer file user guide was useful. This is not a scanner for you if you want a simple product to input a few family photos.

526541,AVBOCSETZ2VQ9,0,0,53,B000F3YSQ4,4/26/2006,5,154,155,"Despite a few problems, I am ecstatic about this system!","I purchased this scanner to improve the operation of my CPA office (consulting/audit practice), and to get rid of a good part of (roughly 40 crates of) files I have accumulated over my career. Before making this purchase I reviewed the CPA Computer report Accountants Guide to Going Paperless, the AICPA IT section whitepapers, I attended a few paperless workshops, and I read Amazon reviews of earlier Fujitsu products and Visioneer products. My unit serial number was #5XX, so mine is one of the first of this model sold. This review is based on only one week of experience using the S500, but I think it is better to share this information now than to wait until I have more to report. The S500 appears to be similar to the previous model the FI5110EOX2 which has been heavily, and positively, reviewed on Amazon and also in the references listed above. Differences between the S500 and the earlier 5110 are as follows - * Integration with ABBY OCR, so the S500 can produce searchable PDF's and other formats!!! This was a major limitation with the 5110EOX2 which could only produce graphic PDFs.  The ABBY OCR is not perfect, but hopefully gets enough keywords right to make the document findable. * One touch scan to PDF, to Word, to Excel, to Power Point, to ScanSnap Organizer (which produces searchable PDFs), and to Cardminder (for business cards). * Inclusion of Adobe Acrobat 7.0! * 20% improved scan speed (up to 16 pages per minute, with a 50 page feed bin), and the ability to append consecutive batches to the same PDF file. In practice I think I will often be using highest resolution (Excellent, 1200dpi/600dpicolor) mode with max compression, which is significantly slower - about 25sec/page scan time and 10sec/page OCR time on my new Compaq presario laptop.  The lower resolution modes (going down to Fastest, 300dpi/150dpicolor) might be sufficient for older print documents without marks or illustrations, that do not have much value to me, that I doubt I will ever look at again but can't just toss. * Automatic document size detection so you can feed batches of mixed size documents. (plus all the document handling features from the 5110, including reasonably good automatic handling of mixed single sided and double sided documents) * File compression which is claimed to reduce file sizes 20-50 percent. * A significant cash manufacturers [censored] for purchases from authorized dealers is currently available for this product through the Fujitsu website. Here are the limitations I have seen with this scanner so far (4000 scans of documents and business cards) - * It sometimes feeds two sheets at once, most often the first two sheets in a batch, so I will have to keep my eye on the first sheets it feeds. If the documents have page numbers it will be easy to know how many documents I have fed and compare this with the scanner count. If the documents do not have page numbers I will need to count them by hand, or keep I very close eye on the scanner throughout the scan, or just live with a very occasional missed page due to the mechanism feeding two sheets at once. * I assume staples will damage the mechanism, and so I will have to carefully inspect all documents for staples before scanning. * The OCR is alright but not perfect. There are frequent OCR mistakes when scanning business cards, and several mistakes per page on spreadsheets (7's sometimes become 1's, 5's sometimes become S's, 0's sometimes become O's, missing decimal points, extra junk characters etc). White text on black background and black text on grey background have poor results. Fortunately the graphic image is retained in the searchable PDF, and is also retained in Cardminder, so that even when the OCR is not perfect I can still see what the original looked like. * If a spreadsheet had relationships between the columns, I can recalculate the relationship and compare my recalculation with the scanned information, which seems to detect almost all errors in scans to Excel. * Scan to Word often results in a slightly different format or positioning of text than the original document. * The scanner does not support TWAIN (a uniform driver interface for scanners), instead it has a proprietary interface. Based on my research, the proprietary interface is better than TWAIN, so if the included software meets your needs then this is not a limitation. However if you absolutely must use some 3rd party software that requires TWAIN then you should not buy this scanner! * The PDF files produced by the system are not fully compressed, even with maximum compression selected.  Running PKZIP does not increase the compression significantly, however in Adobe 7.0 I click File | Reduce File Size | For Adobe 7.0 and subsequent, and files compress perhaps by up to 80% !  This additional Adobe compression claims to have no loss of visual quality and is fast for PDFs of a few megabytes, but quite slow for huge PDFs, and seems to produce much more additional compression on high resolution scans than on low resolution scans.  Why can't Fujitsu/Abby use this Adobe 7.0 super compressed mode to begin with or add it to their batch process manager?  I have not figured out how to get the system to reduce this annoying extra process step. * After installing the scanner, Outlook caused my XP system to hang three times a day with a fatal ""STOP ERROR"" causing a blue screen and a reboot. I called tech support, and found it very easy to reach a live person who listened to me sympathetically and had some useful troubleshooting information, but did not have an immediate fix and took me down a few false paths. Microsoft crash analysis was worse than useless and incorrectly concluded that the problem was in my graphics driver which was not the case. In the end, through trial and error, I diagnosed the problem myself. It turned out that the Blue Soleil bluetooth USB wireless networking drivers installed in my system and plugged into Outlook were incompatible with something in the S500 package, perhaps with the S500 drivers or the Adobe 7.0 Outlook plugin. Uninstalling Blue Soleil caused the problem to go away completely. * Every now and then (2%?) of scans, when I press the green scan button or when I click continue in the scansnap manager window, the image scanning and file saving window comes up on my screen, but the feed motor never starts turning.  The system appears locked up, and the only way to reliably start scanning again seems to be to disconnect and reconnect the power plug on the back of the scanner. * When scanning paper that is rough or perforated, sometimes the ejecting page will push the previously scanned page out of its neat stack in the output pile, and in the worst case spill several pages from the output pile onto the floor!  I have learned to place the scanner at the rear of a deep desk, and to set a block at the front of the desk at the front end of output pile to push back against any paper that tries to fall out. * I was able to use the software to convert some previously scanned graphic PDFs to searchable PDF's, however the Abby manual does claim that only files produced by ScanSnap are supported (though I suppose one could always print a hardcopy and then scan it again using ScanSnap). Despite the problems listed above, this system is helping me better communicate with my clients, and in the long term I think it will significantly reduce the clutter in my office.",0,3854,Fujitsu Imaging,436.99,Fujitsu ScanSnap S500 Clr 18PPM/36IPM Dupl Scanner,EAN->0097564307003,Binding->Electronics,Feature->One button scanning to searchable PDF,Brand->FUJITSU,Feature->Scan directly to Microsoft applications,ItemDimensions,Label->Fujitsu Imaging,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

526540,A1Y29X25XTIJPL,0,1,52,B000F3YSQ4,5/11/2006,4,48,49,Excellent buy!,"I was looking for a scanner that could digitize pages larger (in length) that standard letter size (8,5x11 inches). In my country (Chile) nobody now sells legal size scanners (or almost scanners at all - they have all moved to multifunctional devices). When shopping at Amazon for this specific figure, I found this very new product (even in the Fujitsu page it is quite new). I wondered if it would work for my needs. In that sense, Scansnap S500 was and is an excellent buy. It worked flawlessly from the first scan. I was surprised with the speed of the scans! I couldn't measure the speed, but I believe from the jobs I did that the 18PPM speed is accurate. The adobe acrobat standard version 7.0 is an excellent bundle, as well as the ScanSnap Organizer and the ABBYY Finereader OCR software. I was very pleased with the simple way of scanning the documents with the software. Put the batch, press a green button and that's it. ScanSnap Organizer pops up and everything goes smoothly. Afterwards, I can edit the documents with Adobe Acrobat. Why I didn't give it 5 stars: very simple - the driver from Fujitsu does not comply with the Windows logo testing. A warning pops up when plugging the USB cable and windows XP detects the hardware. Fujitsu should spend just the little effort that is needed to get the driver properly certified. This is not the time of the Apple III, Macintosh or Original IBM PC, where writing a driver was a major task. The same with the minimum effort that means developing a driver that is Twain/ISIS compliant. These two minor issues should be addressed by Fujitsu soon. Both issues were clearly documented, so no surprises. At least the documentation is very clear about them. In summary, I really recommend the product for its use.

526539,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,0,1,51,B000F3YSQ4,6/2/2007,4,23,23,amazingly fast document scanner,"Wow!  That is the first word that came to my mind when I scanned my first document with the Fujitsu S500 scanner.  Wow!  It scanned so quickly that I wasn't sure I did it correctly until I saw the .pdf file pop up in Adobe Acrobat only moments later.  If you are needing a fast document scanner, you need look no further. Everything about this scanner reflects quality.  It arrives well-packaged with all necessary connecting cables, software (including Adobe Acrobat 7 standard edition), and documentation.  The S500 is much smaller than I had envisioned from its picture, but this is a big benefit as it takes up very little space on the desktop.  Despite its small size, the scanner feels solidly built.  The power supply has a standard detachable AC cord so there is no brick to take up valuable outlet space.  The printed documentation is outstanding.  A full-sized printed manual is provided (in several languages) which is detailed and thorough.  The S500 scanner is quite intuitive to use, but the manual leaves no question about how to use it properly. The scanner opens somewhat like a flower.  One simply lifts up the lid, which forms a backboard for your documents, and then fold down an inner lip to catch the scanned documents as they exit the scanner.  A power button is present when you open up the scanner, but you really never need to use it -- the scanner automatically turns on when you open it up and shuts itself off when you fold everything back in place.  The only other button is a large scan button, which makes scanning documents extremely simple.  When closed back up the scanner's interior is completely covered, keeping it dust-free. The S500 scanner is very versatile.  You can scan full-color documents in a wide variety of sizes without any special configuration -- the scanner will automatically sense their margins and make the appropriate scan.  I found this even worked with thin, thermal paper credit card receipts without any special handling.  You can place a stack of documents in the scanner and configure it to scan them automatically and in sequence.  Odd-sized documents (e.g. newspaper clippings, photographs, etc.) can be scanned using the included carrier sheet.  The scanner can be configured to send scanned documents to a variety of programs including Adobe Acrobat; Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint; Cardminder (a business card organizer that can route scanned business cards directly into Microsoft Outlook); ABBYY Finereader (an OCR software); and SnapScan Organizer (a .pdf organizer).  The software can also be configured to make searchable .pdf files.  All of the software mentioned above, except for the Microsoft Office software, is included with the scanner.  The S500 is small enough that it could be easily used as a portable scanner.  In fact, a carry case is available for separate purchase from online vendors. The thing that really sets the Fujitsu S500 scanner apart from other scanners is its blazing speed.  The S500 warms up very rapidly (literally within seconds), scans a document on one or both sides automatically within seconds, and quickly generates a full-color .pdf file.  I have never seen such a fast scanner.  You really have to see it to believe it.  By comparison, it would take me several minutes to scan even a single document on one side with my Hewlett Packard 6300c flatbed scanner.  The difference in scanning speed is absolutely incredible.  Despite its rapid scanning speed, document scan quality is quite good with the S500, and it is certainly good enough for accurate OCR with the included ABBYY Finereader software.  Scanning resolution can be adjusted, although it is a little awkward to configure.  Scanned images are inferior with the S500 even when configured to scan at the highest resolution/quality setting.  My flatbed scanner clearly makes nicer image scans, although it takes much longer to produce them. Fujitsu's customer service is somewhat lacking.  My scanner arrived with a corrupt SnapScan setup disk.  Calling Fujitsu customer service sent me on a merry chase from one phone menu to another.  It took seemingly forever to ultimately connect with a human.  Once I did, though, the friendly customer service representative directed me to Fujitsu's ftp site where I was able to download the needed software and burn my own replacement CD.  I'm sure they would have happily mailed me a replacement if I had requested it.  Where the service is lacking, aside from the maddening loops of phone menus, is the poor sales support.  If you call customer service for pre-sales information, after going through endless phone menus, you will ultimately be told to leave a voicemail for a representative to call you back.  The S500 owners manual recommends replacing the scanner carrier sheet after 500 scans and provides a part number for a 5-pack of carrier sheets (which turns out not to be a correct part number).  But you cannot purchase replacement carrier sheets from Fujitsu!  The Fujitsu customer service agent I spoke with had no idea where you could purchase replacement carrier sheets and referred me to a 3rd party vendor in New York who said they could order them but couldn't give me an accurate price.  Eventually, I found online vendors where they can be purchased after doing a Google search (I have since found out you can purchase them through an Amazon vendor). There are some negative aspects to the S500 scanner.  Since it is designed to be used primarily as a document scanner you can scan only sheet-fed individual documents.  You cannot scan books or any other bound materials unless you unbind them into individual sheets.  There is no Twain driver for the S500 scanner (Fujitsu sells other scanner models that do have a Twain driver), so you cannot make scans within other programs -- instead, all scans have to be made through the SnapScan program, which can then direct them to the programs mentioned earlier in this review.  This limits the software you can use with the S500 scanner.  Depending upon what you intend to scan, you have to readjust the configuration settings within the SnapScan program before your scan.  This is awkward and should be more automatic.  It takes only seconds, however, to make these adjustments.  As mentioned above, scan quality for images is somewhat poor.  The S500 is not the scanner to use if you want to scan primarily images or photos.  Lastly, customer service support for this scanner leaves a lot to be desired. In summary, the Fujitsu S500 scanner is a blazingly fast, compact, high-quality scanner that comes fully-equipped with excellent software including Adobe Acrobat standard.  You will find yourself looking for documents to scan with it.  The scanner is well worth its higher price.  If you are searching for a fast, high-quality document scanner, you need look no further.  However, if you are primarily wanting high-quality image or photo scans, you will probably prefer a good flatbed image scanner.  Please also note the Fujitsu S500 is a Windows-only scanner, so you will want to purchase the S500M model for usage with a Mac.",0,3854,Fujitsu Imaging,436.99,Fujitsu ScanSnap S500 Clr 18PPM/36IPM Dupl Scanner,EAN->0097564307003,Binding->Electronics,Feature->One button scanning to searchable PDF,Brand->FUJITSU,Feature->Scan directly to Microsoft applications,ItemDimensions,Label->Fujitsu Imaging,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

It has worked out flawlessly for me so far. I made a New Year's resolution to go paperless this year and have been busy converting all my utility, bank and investment accounts over. Most companies are very happy to comply as they like the cost savings of not having to print and mail statements and will archive the old records for years. However there are some small firms that send you mostly occasional statements and the like that you can not convert to paperless billing. In addition there are plenty of routine mail we all receive that we have to faithfully file away for tax time or the occasional time you need to check back on. Add to this the clippings you have saved, be it recipes, hobby interests or whatever that fill many a file folder each year. Now I simply pass them through the auto paper handler on the ScanSnap and convert them to searchable PDFs in seconds. I set up a complete set of 'file folders' or 'cabinets' as Fujitsu likes to call them and drag the newly created PDFs over using their software or Windows Explorer. I also have been slowly emptying old file folders and scanning in 20-30 pages of old bills and statements at a time when ever I have spare time. It is my goal to recycle two complete file cabinets this spring! So far (3 weeks) the scanner has been working great and I love the convenience of the whole system. Oh and another thing that is great, I travel a lot between two residences, boating and of course the office - and it always seems the stuff I need is somewhere else.

526447,A24TCU4X4T7AAQ,0,1,46,B000FA1G26,4/10/2006,5,96,98,Working great for me!,"I need to first say that I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this unit and have spent a great deal of time researching previous models XS-32/34/52/54, and read many, many, many user reviews on them, as well as downloaded and reviewed the installation and operation user manuals for most of them. After all my research I narrowed it down to 2 models which best suited my needs, the XS52 and this one, XS35. They are both very similar using the same 160 GB HD, same IR blaster funtion to set top cable/sat box, and same navigation software, but there are a few major differences.  The XS52 will only burn to -R/-RAM while the XS35 will burn to -R/-RW and -RAM. Why they left -RW out of XS52, I don't know.  The other thing is that the XS52 uses the VCR+ Plus timer recording feature where the XS35 uses the TVGuide OnScreen system.  VCR+ Plus codes are not listed in my local paper or guide, so this would be a pain for me to have to search for and setup, although I am sure it works fine, the TVGOS is much easier for me.  The last difference I could see is the XS52 offers an HDMI output and upconversion on DVD playback to 480p, 720p and 1080i for ""near-HD"" quality. The only thing I didn't like about the XS35 was that it didn't have the upconversion like the XS52, but was I really missing something here??? I wanted to know if I should get the XS52 for the upconversion, so I brought home a Toshiba upconverting DVD player to see if I could tell the difference in quality between it and the XS35's progressive scan DVD player.  After watching my favourite scenes on many DVD's I decided that I could not tell any difference which made my choice much easier.  I wanted to save my HDMI input on my TV for later this year or next year when HD DVD/Blu-ray become more available, those DVD's will make a huge difference.  So I went out and bought the XS35. Some of the features of the XS35: 1) TVGOS program guide:  A lot of people have been reporting problems with this on older versions.  I cannot say that I have had any problems with this.  In fact it was the easiest thing to set up.  It simply asks for your zip/postal code and within 24 hours of setup it has downloaded all the channels to it's guide and all the programming for 8 days.  This is very convienient to use with the timer programming, I can tape ""Lost"" weekly and ""South Park"" daily and it will do it for me.  So far I really enjoy this system since I don't have cable or satellite and I don't have a guide, this is really nice to see what is on next. If I did have a Cable/Sat box I could use the IR blaster to change to channel 405 at 10:00 pm then to channel 253 at 12:00 pm and it would do it.  This is what the manual says and although I have not used this feature it is a nice one to have for potential future use. You can also just press REC and start recording to the HDD instantly instead of setting up a timed recording.  Just press stop to stop it. 2) DVD - the playback is as good as I could imagine.  I had been using my Xbox as a DVD player.  I can't say I see any huge differences or improvements, but it isn't worse either.  Both are great for me. The benefit is that I can burn to DVD anything I want to keep, (superbowl, movies on tv, seasons of tv shows, etc.) It does support both DVD-R/RW and RAM unlike XS52 which only supports -R and -RAM. 3) The fan does not run all the time, like many have said about the XS54.  It is very quiet when it does run. The lights on the front make it easy to see what you are doing at the moment.  If you are recording there is a red light ring around one of the buttons on the front of the unit. If you are on the HDD a blue light is on and when on the DVD it lights up green.  There are separate lights too not just one so if you are color blind (like my dad) you are not confused by only one light position. 4) The easy-navi button gets you right into the list of programs you have saved and is easy to use.  Easy to delete when finished with a certain recording and it tells you how much time you have left to use on the disk to manage your files. 5) Playback - Great playback features.  You can playback a recording while recording another program live. You can also pause live TV with the Timeslip feature and then skip through commercials in 5s, 10s, 30s or 5 minute intervals to catch up to the live feed, also skip back at 5 s intervals if you missed something. All in all I am happy with this HDD/DVD recorder and despite not having the HDMI upconversion for DVD playback (which I can't see a difference in anyway) it has everything I think you could want. There are going to be other units Panasonic/Pioneer available that do similar things but I like the way this one works. 5 stars from me...good luck!",0,2499,Toshiba,499.99,Toshiba RD-XS35 DVD Player/Recorder with 160 GB Hard Drive,EAN->0022265412039,Binding->Electronics,Feature->DVD player/recorder with 160 GB hard drive; measures 17 x 2.5 x 13.25 inches (WxHxD),Brand->Toshiba,"Feature->Records onto DVD-R/RW and DVD-RAM discs; plays CD-R/RW, VCD, MP3, WMA, JPEG",ItemDimensions,Label->Toshiba,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

526446,A3RRBPUGD7UOSP,0,0,45,B000FA1G26,8/23/2006,4,37,39,"A Few Minor Issues, But a Great Unit","My wife and I purchased this unit as a co-anniversary present to each other. We wanted to replace a VCR that was used to occasionally tape TV shows, the news, etc., so we decided on a DVD recorder that had a hard drive for DVR recording. I read reviews on various models, and decided on this one. I haven't been disappointed. While some reviewers mention the fan noise as a problem, I haven't seen it as such. The fan (apparently) is temp-controlled, because it seems to get louder when using the unit, and stays louder for a few minutes after the unit is shut off. It's not incredibly loud, but it is noticeable. The one negative I have to agree with other reviewers on is the manual and on-screen guide. They are not user intuitive at all. I am a highly technical person, and spent quite a while the first night trying to figure out how to play a DVD, even after thumbing through the manual. Now that I've figured out how to use the DVD player, I've watched a dozen or so DVDs, and have absolutely no complaints. The video and sound playback are excellent. I've used the DVR a half dozen times, and love it. I don't know how I survived without it. You simply go to a show on the TV guide on-screen, and press the record button. That is, after you've set up the basic recorder settings when you first unpack the unit. Once the unit records, you go to the 'content menu' which shows the shows you've recorded, the title, channel, etc, and even shows a screenshot! To play it back, you navigate to the one you want to watch and press 'play'. The coolest thing about it, and the DVD player, is that when you stop a show or disk, turn the unit off, and come back later, the unit knows exactly where you were when you stopped, and resumes from there. Sweet! I'm set up to record a show using the DVR, that I will burn to a DVD. I will update my review once that is done, so that I can give my impression of that part of the unit, which is the only thing I've yet to do with it. 12-4-06 - Update Now that I've had the unit for a couple of months, I wanted to update my review, especially having had time to play with the DVD authoring aspect of the unit, which for me was a secondary item. I wanted the unit mostly for the ability to DVR without having to pay TiVo a monthly fee. The DVR works flawlessly, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've burned a handful of DVD disks using the unit and found it not particularly easy to do, although not overtly so. The manual, as previously noted, is not a lot of help.  Of the 5 disks that I've burned, three of them were 'fully authored', meaning that I went in and manually added chapter breaks, created thumbnails for each chapter and for the main menu for each episode. This is VERY time consuming, so I didn't do it on the last two disks. The fourth disk causes any DVD player I put it in to lockup after five minutes or so. I don't know if this is because the unit automatically puts in chapter breaks at 5 minute intervals or what. I'm going to edit the content of that fourth disk, and burn it again to see if that makes the difference. As a side note, I found that the unit will not recognize DVD+R disks, so you have to make sure you use DVD-R or DVD-RW formatted ones.",0,2499,Toshiba,499.99,Toshiba RD-XS35 DVD Player/Recorder with 160 GB Hard Drive,EAN->0022265412039,Binding->Electronics,Feature->DVD player/recorder with 160 GB hard drive; measures 17 x 2.5 x 13.25 inches (WxHxD),Brand->Toshiba,"Feature->Records onto DVD-R/RW and DVD-RAM discs; plays CD-R/RW, VCD, MP3, WMA, JPEG",ItemDimensions,Label->Toshiba,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

526442,ANKF54Y5737A1,0,1,41,B000FA1G26,7/11/2006,5,11,11,No Complaints Yet! - Updated 03.07.07,"This was a birthday present to myself so, I had the unit barely a month. [Update 03.07.07 - Almost a year later and still going strong!] My unit gets cable directly from a wire coming out the wall, no cable box. (I have a funny story how that wire was a really good antennae...)  That said, the TVGOS worked within 24hrs, I've had no problem since.  Very nice to have a week's teeevee listings and not need the teeevee guide in the paper.  The TVGOS allows searching for shows by alphabetical, keyword, genre or just scanning the grid for listings. The manual is more like a magazine, I would advise you to work with this machine frequently, and keep the manual nearby.  I didn't have much problem with the language of the manual, and everything is pretty much laid out straightforwardly. My only criticism re: the manual is that it could use an index. This is not the most intuitive machine in the world, it is complicated, and it'll be a while before you get things doped out.  The unit provides a handful of indicators of it's activity at any given moment, and indicates whether you are working with the HDD or the DVD drive. One thing that is good is that there are usually a few methods and menus to do similar actions. To date, I have recorded shows using the TVGOS, recorded shows just by hitting the ""Rec"" button on the remote and I have recorded shows from one of my VCRs directly to the HDD.  At present, I have started to record to DVD-RAM discs in order to not used the HDD extensively.  You can edit on either disc drive (Update 03.07.07 - provided you use a DVD-RAM disc).  I have also loaded DVD-RAM discs from my old DVD recorder, though programs from those discs must be loaded on to the HDD to do any editing.  I have copied back and forth between discs and copied edited programs to DVD-R/RW for finalization.  This can be done in a ""high speed"" mode or in some cases you have to do it in real time. The deal is that you have an ""Original"" program that you set edit points within, and then edit together the ""chapters"" that you wish to make your final program which the unit calls a ""Playlist"".  If you are satisfied with the playlist, then you make a copy and the ""Playlist"" becomes an ""Original"".  DON'T delete the ""Original"" before making your ""Playlist"" an ""Original"" or you will have nothing. Re:  The Program Editor Mode I find it a little clunky. You can set edit points with four rocker switches on the remote which set the points forward or back at various speeds.  CAVEAT! The edit points wind up being a little sloppy on the finished discs, they don't wind up exactly where you want them, they kind of wind up maybe a few frames earlier than you have set them for.  YMMV, I like to take out the commercials and leave a little more dark space than most broadcasters provide (Usually less than a second!) so you may wind up with the last frame or two of the end of a commercial. [Update 03.07.07 - When setting the edit points after any given commercial break, you should allow a buffer of about 13 frames after the end of the last commercial and the resumption of the program.  If you don't do this, then you will see about half a second of the end of the last commercial.  Nitpicky, yes, but you may want a smoother transition between scenes and you DID want to edit out the commercials...] So far, I am happy with the machine, I haven't had any of the problems with the fan being loud, didn't even notice it till I had to change some wires and I was directly behind the thing. [Update 03.07.07 - I did have a problem once with the Program Editor Mode where the time elapsed indicator wouldn't indicate the elapsed time and the window showing the program being edited in progress wouldn't work properly.  The time elapsed on the program being viewed wouldn't be indicated on the front of the unit, and a few other features wouldn't operate. I phoned Toshiba, got a prompt answer from a live operator who had me unplug, then re-plug the machine.  I did so and all functionality returned to the machine and I lost none of the programs I had on HDD.] I made sure to get a 2 year extended service contract though... One thing: The volume level when using the RCA jacks directly into the audio in of my teeevee is really low.  This does not affect the finished product when I put it in my plain old DVD player I use strictly for playing DVDs. Edit: Another thing: DO NOT (!) use Verbatim brand DVD-RW discs on the spindle, I have moved to Memorex brand in the individual jewel cases, presumably non-spindle discs are manufactured to a higher tolerance.  The Verbatim discs typically wouldn't Format, or would Format after 3 tries, but the disc would fail on Finalize mode, creating another drink coaster. [Update 03.07.07 - I stand my my recommendation of Memorex brand discs, and have used TDK as well to near 100% success, even using those on a spindle.]",0,2499,Toshiba,499.99,Toshiba RD-XS35 DVD Player/Recorder with 160 GB Hard Drive,EAN->0022265412039,Binding->Electronics,Feature->DVD player/recorder with 160 GB hard drive; measures 17 x 2.5 x 13.25 inches (WxHxD),Brand->Toshiba,"Feature->Records onto DVD-R/RW and DVD-RAM discs; plays CD-R/RW, VCD, MP3, WMA, JPEG",ItemDimensions,Label->Toshiba,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

The manual recommended Maxell DVD-R blank disks for recording, I got the 16X version, no problems so far. I haven't tried DVD-RWs and don't care if I do. The TV Guide works as promised, I have Time-Warner Cable. I have copied some old programs from VHS to the hard drive , then to DVD-R after editing out the commercials, the final picture quality was the same as the original VHS which is to be expected. The picture quality is very good from the new shows copied from cable to hard drive to DVD, again as expected. Some of the issues from other reviewers I researched before buying: Cooling fan runs alot (yes it does, doesn't bother me), Manual (Could have been better but I understood it), Remote buttons (a lot of them, just watch what you're doing), Setting up recording off TV (both from TV Guide or manually, read the manual and watch what you're doing). I've had it for 2 months now and no problems, most of the shows I watch have to be recorded while I'm at work and I used to switch several VHS tapes around.

First, it has great sound with decent left/right speakers, and a subwoofer below the unit. It has a Surround Sound button, a 4-band equalizer, and separate treble/base settings (in case you don't want to use one of the preset equalizer settings).  It has 10 FM and 10 AM preset buttons.  It can play regular CDs and mp3 CDs.  The docking station supports every variation of ipods, including the ipod shuffle. It also is an Alarm clock that allows to you wake up to buzzer, radio, CD, or ipod (not ipod shuffle though).  The docking station actually charges the ipod shuffle even when the iE600BK power is off.  Like most alarm clocks, it also has a ""sleep"" button to allow the unit to turn itself off after 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes.  It has an AUX input and an earphone jack.  It has a very contemporary look - black with blue neon side-lights that light up when the power is on (the sidelights can be turned off).  Here are the few negatives:  It does not have a resume feature for picking up an mp3 at the last spot you left off.  While the remote control operates all operations on the machine and any ipod, the remote does not operate the ipod shuffle.  You must use the buttons on the ipod shuffle itself.

But the phone works great with Skype once it's setup properly.  The range is incredible!  I have a three story house and my computer is all the way upstairs jammed in the far corner of the house.  The signal is excellent all the way down to the bottom level of my home, and to the other end.  I may save some a little confusion by letting you know that the phone takes over as your pc speaker while the phone is in use.  So if you end a call, and then sign onto AOL or start playing a song, the audio plays in the phone, and not on the PC speakers.  I finally figured out that the phone goes into ""sleep"" mode 3 minutes after you stop using it, and the audio is restored to the PC speakers.  For those who want to fidget with the audio settings, there are settings in both Windows XP as well as the Skype settings.  I just left my settings ""as is"".  Seems to get the job done!  I also might mention that I have Linksys Wireless SRX Router downstairs in my office.  When I'm very close to the router, it does cause a little static/hiss with the phone reception.

As such it has all the tools a serious chess player can want - a million game database, training and analysis modes, a year's subscription to Playchess, etc. I own both Fritz 9 and Hiarcs 10 and thouroghly recommend both. Fritz and Hiarcs have long been rivals. In playing strength Fritz has usually been slightly stronger (at least in games against other engines.) However,strength (particularly against other computers) is not the only consideration. The top 5 engines are certainly a match for the world's top grandmasters, and what an owner wants is a program that is useful for analysis. What Hiarcs offers is its own unique playing style. It is often said that Hiarcs is the most ""human-like"" computer opponent. To my mind no computer really plays like a human but I can understand what the many Hiarcs fans mean. Hiarcs has a very individual style and is less material-oriented than many programs, often ignoring the gain of a pawn, for example, in favour of the initiative. In keeping with this style of play the program comes with an opening book that is decidedly quirky, with all sorts of interesting lines of play.

Those that won't fit in the sleeves will fit in the pockets up front. Because of the unique design of the locking system however, inserting papges is not particularly easy -- the rings lock in front of the first page, so to insert a page, you have to pull out all of the pages in front of it.  It would have made more sense to have it lock in the back -- that is where you would either want to add pages, or remove the extra ones. All in all, we are pleased ... it is a great way to store our cd's, it gets rid of that major shelving system we bought only for our discs, and, frankly, the discs are more accessible, than in some of those fancy jewell cases. My favorite aspect of the wallets is that we actually listen to our music more -- we were storing our discs in our library -- away from our stereo, so you actually had to make an effort to pull the discs if you wanted to listen to them.  Because these books are so much more portable, they are where our stereo is. I foresee the future holding all music electronically, on demand.  But in the meantime, several of us own thousands of CD's and this seems to be the best way to store and protect them.

I have 3 CDW-320's, each holding a different genre of music.  In a fire, I could grab all three cases and go, where that would've been impossible before.  By my calculations, the physical space used by my CD collection has decreased by 40%! The way to do what I did is to get rid of the jewel cases entirely.  To do that, do this for each CD you own: 1)  Each side of each CDW-320 page has four pockets.  Put the CD in one of the two top-most Pockets on a page. 2)  Put the CD's booklet in the pocket underneath its CD. 3)  Finally, pop open the CD case (it takes just a little force) and pry out the back-of-the-CD card.  Straighten out the folds of that card, and slide it in sideways into the bottom pocket, behind the CD's booklet.  It  will stick up over the top of the pocket, but since it's in the bottom and the CD's in the top, it doesn't hurt anything.  The back card will just cover up a little of the CD. Continuing in this fashion will allow you to fill up the wallet with 160 CDs, since each CD takes up two pockets.  Double and Triple CD cases work similarly, and just use up more pocket-pairs. When you take out a CD to play it, you can take out the booklet too, and see the back-card with the tracklisting through the clear pockets.  You never have to take the back-card out, which is good, since its straightened-out folds may be delicate and may rip with too much handling. Finally, you can recycle the jewel cases, saving a few in case you want to lend a CD to someone. One other plus to this one over the other Case Logic cases:  not only is it the biggest, but it allows the pages to be removed and shuffled.

Our own company email system will support the Palm and Pocket PC while it will not be supporting the Blackberry Enterprise System anytime soon. So the Outlook support is very important. Bluetooth: The Bluetooth seems designed for devices to enable mobiles, LAN and PC connections to give web capability. It would be clunky, in my view, to connect via a cell phone, so I'd love to see WiFi. But this feature can be added with a $99 card put into the SDI slot. Bluetooth is not as easy to configure; the set-up wizard seemed to be a bit difficult and there are only a few cell phone models included in the preset configurations. If you can get the 72 connected, you can use it to dial numbers, send SMS, MMS and e-mail, and browse the web using the Web Pro 3.5. Or you can opt for a WiFi card and surf at MacDonalds and Starbucks. Phones that are listed: Sony-E T68i Sony-E T610 Nokia 6310i Nokia 3650 Siemens S56 Not a super list. For PC interfacing or Palm-to-Palm there still is an infrared port. Egonomics: Complaints were made about the blue paint on the regular edition flaking off. I have the special edition with the silver body and this is not an issue. The control is a rectangular navigating button. The screen has the familiar Palm division between screen and stylus pad below. The Graffiti 2 was easy to use--the letters are almost exactly like written print, as long as you know where to begin the the letter, but that's practically intuitive. The sensitivity and accuracy of the stylus-pointing is a huge improvement over the very early Palms like the PalmV. My system came with a Cordura nylon case, very nice quality and a huge improvement from the old flimsy leatherette flaps of early days. Without a case, you have to get something to cover the screen. The stylus is the same type of rod that attaches to the side by sliding into a slot. MP3: You need a SDI card (Secure Digital card) to load MP3 songs with RealPlayer onto the system for playing back with MP3. These are not hard to find, you may even have one floating around the house (we did.) Drag-and-drop songs onto the card on your PC, put card in Palm and go. There is a headphone jack. There are ""speakers"" (tiny) and a voice recorder. Great for memos. Camera: The 1.2 megapixel camera has onboard adjustments for contrast and light (I needed to take down the exposure for a shot of my deck at dawn.) Digital zoom. No cover for the camera lens. The resolution was ok. The memory will hold about 85 shots, and you can move them to the SDI (optional) card. No flash. Software: The installation CD comes with Adobe Acrobat Reader for Palm, plus a calculator, a reader-- Documents To Go which allows you to read Microsoft Word and Excel. It's recommended to download AvantGo to add internet features. Sites such as www.palmsource.com, www.freewarepalm.com, www.palmgear.com, www.download.com have many free or inexpensive applications for the PalmOS. There is no manual, it's on the CD. Summary: For a PDA, this is about perfect. To be perfect, they'd have to include WiFi and or a better phone setup list for the Bluetooth. I am quite thrilled with the Zire 72--it does what I want it to do, mainly be a PDA and keep my appointments and handle some data. The camera and MP3 are nice for travel.",0,11360,PalmOne,249.99,PalmOne Zire 72 Special Edition Handheld Silver,Binding->Electronics,BatteriesIncluded->1,Brand->PALM,BatteryType->Lithium Polymer,CPUSpeed->312,"Feature->Expansion slot that supports MMC, SD, and SDIO memory cards",Feature->Palm Desktop Software for Windows and Mac and Software Essentials CD included,Label->PalmOne,ListPrice,Manufacturer->PalmOne,Model->P80722US-SE,MPN->P80722US-SE,NumberOfItems->1,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,Publisher->PalmOne,CPUType->XScale PXA270,EAN->0805931014665,"Feature->Bright, 320x320 transflective TFT color display supports more than 65,000 colors","Feature->312 MHz Intel PXA270 processor, Palm OS v5.2.8, 32 MB RAM (24 MB actual storage)",Feature->Integrated 1.2 MP digital camera that also shoots video

573727,A8XPDCA63HJ8S,0,0,14,B0007RB2BM,6/10/2005,5,188,188,Great choice if you want to save money,"If you want a decent quality MP3 player but don't want to spend much, this is an excellent choice.  I have used mine for several months and I'm very satisfied with it.  It's also a fine CD player though I primarily use MP3 CDs.  It's worth noting that CD-R/RWs are probably the cheapest digital media format, so when it comes to MP3s, you will also save money there. Here are the main pros and cons... Pros: -Very inexpensive considering the potential capacity (650-700+MB per disc). -Good sound quality.  I don't think you can do much better for under $50 (or even $100). -Great battery life.  I used it every day for well over a month before I had to replace the batteries.  Maybe not the full 85 hours under (my) normal listening conditions, but close enough. -Startup load time for MP3 CDs is fairly short.  After that, switching between songs is virtually as fast as a normal CD.  It is worth noting that if you have mp3 tracks that are supposed to transition into each other (like in the Gladiator soundtrack) there will be a slight pause between them. -Very good at finding and playing all the MP3s even on CDs containing considerable amounts of non-MP3 data. -Has a very good resume feature with MP3s.  Even if it does sometimes need to rescan the disc when it's powered on, it always picks up where I left off. Cons: -No track seeking for MP3s.  Be aware that this is a con for every MP3 CD player that I know of (except for a computer).  Shouldn't be a problem for most content except for audio books.  It does have a good resume feature though... -No ID3 tag support.  It would be nice to see the song titles, but it's not really important to me.  As long as you keep your MP3s in well organized folders, it's easy to figure out what's playing. -There are smaller MP3 players out there.  It does fit into some of my clothing pockets but since I'm not Guybrush Threepwood, it looks weird and is not comfortable.  If size is a major issue, then you probably should consider a non-CD MP3 player.  It's worth noting that it doesn't take up unnecessary space.  Actually it's probably as small as any CD player with an internal AA battery compartment can get. Miscellaneous: -Has 4 Equalizer modes: -OFF: A nice, crisp neutral sound. -S-XBS: A rich and warm bass sound. -S-XBS+: Very heavy bass.  Too heavy for some songs, but nice for others. -Live: This seems to add some treble and reverb.  Interesting, but some songs sound strange if they already have reverb. -Headphones are decent quality but there's not anything special about them.  If you need to move around while listening you probably should buy a different style.",0,6837,Panasonic,39.95,Panasonic SL-SX450 Portable CD / MP3 Player,Binding->Electronics,BatteriesIncluded->1,Brand->Panasonic,Batteries->2,EAN->0037988252510,IsAutographed->0,IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Panasonic,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Panasonic,Model->SL-SX450,MPN->SL-SX450,NumberOfItems->1,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->CE,"Feature->Slim, affordable personal CD player with 45-second anti-skip memory","Feature->Compatible with CD, CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3 formats",Feature->S-XBS bass boost enhances low tones to improve audio performance,"Feature->20-track programming, random and repeat play, and skip/search functions",Feature->Runs for 50 hours (CD) and 85 hours (MP3) on 2 AA batteries; 1-year warranty

It's the quickest, easiest way to swaddle my baby girl, who sleeps much better at night when she's securely wrapped up.  We went with this kind of swaddle over a blanket because she has been a ""mobile sleeper"" since birth, and always managed to wriggle out of our blanket swaddle.  Note that these notes below pertain to the small size. Now - here's what you need to know about sizing, based on my three months of experience and multiple attempts to get it right. - There are three kinds of swaddle fabrics at the time I'm writing this: 1. Flannel (in the gingham prints) 2. Fleece 3. Cotton jersey (like a t-shirt).  This variety has the most options in terms of patterns and colors. I've arranged them in that order because that's the order of smallest to largest.  The flannel variety stretches, well, not at all. It's the smallest of the three types of fabrics, therefore, in terms of fit.  (My daughter outgrew her small size swaddle at 13 pounds, after washing it a few times - even though it's supposed to fit up to 14.)  The fleece variety does stretch a bit - she's now 15 pounds and this still fits her. The cotton variety is the stretchiest one - and it REALLY stretches.  The first time after I wash and dry it, it's pretty snug.  But if I'm lucky enough to get 2 or 3 nights of use out of it, by the third night it's considerably bigger than it was.  I just bought another small cotton one and my baby's 15 pounds. What's more, I just bought a flannel gingham swaddle in large, and that fits her great.  (But the cotton variety in large was HUGE and I'm returning it.)  Anyway - hope this is helpful to all of you out there.

545119,ADPDMLUDAMML0,0,1,13,B000BJRI1Y,12/31/2005,5,132,132,Who's afraid of the big bad zoom?,"If you like the idea of relatively inexpensive, lightweight, compact zoom binoculars, then look no further.  I just got my pair of Nikon Travelite V Zoom (8-24 x 25 CF) nocs, and I already LOVE them. Don't let the bird watching crowd talk you out of getting a pair of zoom binoculars, folks.  When binocular nuts say that zoom nocs ""don't perform well,"" and try to discourage others from buying them, what they really mean is that most people don't know what to expect when they get their hands on a pair of zooms, and are sometimes unpleasantly surprised to find out they don't work exactly like their favorite fixed magnification nocs. As with all optical tools, zoom nocs are best for certain kinds of uses, and not so good for others.  Specifically, at the bottom end of their range, they ""see"" the same as any fixed mag nocs with the same focal dimensions and optic quality.  However, as you increase the zoom, three things happen:  1) your field of view gets smaller;  2) the visible light coming through the nocs lessens, or, the image gets a little bit ""darker,"" and 3) it becomes more difficult to keep the nocs fixed on your target. Now obviously, if you are attempting to watch something like a small bird in flight, and perhaps even adjust the zoom while trying to keep the nocs focused on your subject at the same time, you will be VERY frustrated with the ""performance"" of these or ANY zoom binoculars.  That isn't because the nocs aren't doing their job ... it's because you're using the wrong kind of optical tool for the task at hand! If, on the other hand, you are looking at a well-lighted subject that is stationary, or not moving around too much, and you just want to get a little closer look at it, you will be absolutely thrilled with what you get from these nocs. Nikon's optics are crystal clear and first rate for the modest price.  The zoom mechanism is simple, smooth and cool.  To ""zoom in"" you simply turn the zoom ring located on the right eyepiece clockwise, and then back the other way to ""zoom out.""  The diopter (that's the adjuster that compensates for focal differences between the right and left eyes of individual users) is located on the left eyepiece.  The nocs are solidly constructed, with a nice ""tight"" feel on all the moving parts, and a black rubber armor covering most of the exterior, for a good grip.  They're very lightweight, fit in your hands like a glove, and come with a neck strap, eyepiece caps, and a custom-fitted, black nylon mesh carrying case with a belt loop on the back. Finally, if you have any difficulty holding the nocs steady at their maximum magification (and most people will), FEAR NOT!  Think about getting an adjustable monopod to rest the nocs on while you look through them, e.g., the PoleCat ""Explorer"" by Stoney Point, with their optional binocular rest.  This monopod can be adjusted to hold your nocs steady for you, whether you're standing or sitting.  It doubles as a walking stick, and has a standard screw mount on the top for use with cameras, camcorders, etc.  I've now gotten and used this little ""extra"" myself, and it has vastly enhanced my enjoyment of the nocs, especially at the higher magnifications. I personally think the negative press on zoom nocs is nonsense.  Just satisfy yourself that zoom nocs are ok for your intended use(s), and then learn how to use them the right way.  I took a chance and bought the Nikon Travelite V zoom nocs, sight unseen, and I'm glad I did.  These are GREAT compact binoculars for the price.",0,938,Nikon,244.95,Nikon 8-24x25 Travelite V Zoom Binocular,EAN->0018208075126,Binding->Electronics,Feature->Advanced zoom control quickly goes from 8x to 24x magnification,Brand->Nikon,Feature->Multicoated optics,Manufacturer->Nikon,Model->7512,MPN->7512,PackageDimensions,ProductGroup->Photography,Publisher->Nikon,Studio->Nikon,Title->Nikon 8-24x25 Travelite V Zoom Binocular,UPC->018208075126,,,Feature->BaK4 high-index prisms,Feature->Compact rubber-coated design for easy grip,Feature->Quick central focusing,Label->Nikon,ListPrice
