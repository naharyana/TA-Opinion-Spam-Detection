Here is some information that might help in deciding which iPod to go for. Apple announced a major upgrade to the iPod lineup today (23 Feb 2005). The biggest advantage is the reduction in price ($ per GB) and improvement in battery life. Another significant change is that USB 2.0 is being emphasized although FireWire continues to be supported. AC adapter is USB based instead of FireWIre and the FireWire based AC adapter still sells as a separate product. The impact on iPod mini: > A new model, iPod mini 6 GB is introduced for $249 > iPod mini 4 GB now priced at $199 ($50 down from earlier price) > Change in colors - now mini is available in new shades of Silver, Blue, Pink, and Green (the Gold color is discontinued) > Major improvement in battery life - up to 18 hours (was 8 hours earlier) > AC adapter ($29) and firewire cable ($19) no longer shipped with mini (you may not need them really) > iPod mini 4 GB and 6 GB now ship with only three things: earphones, belt clip, and USB 2.0 cable > The indicators on the click wheel now match the color of the iPod mini The impact on bigger iPods: > iPod 40 GB is discontinued > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599 > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB) > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them) > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod With these changes, there is an interesting $50 gap between: > iPod 20 GB and iPod photo 30 GB > iPod mini 6 GB and iPod 20 GB (as earlier) > iPod mini 4 GB and iPod mini 6 GB > iPod shuffle 1 GB and iPod mini 4 GB > iPod shuffle 512 MB and iPod shuffle 1 GB (as earlier) Price, size, weight, and ease of use are major considerations while buying an iPod shuffle.  If price is the only factor, iPod mini could be a better choice over shuffle.  I have all the models of iPod (shuffle, mini, regular 40 GB, and photo 60 GB) and I find myself sticking to the iPod photo 60 GB since it carries all my music and has a better, color-based user interface."

653517,A29XUM6HO4WUQ1,0,1,3,B0000AE6C6,3/16/2008,4,0,0,Nice Bag,"I had a hard time deciding on a camera bag.  I have a Nikon D40 and 70-300 VR lens.  I wanted something I could grow into and but not have too much room either.  I looked at some of the backpacks but bought this instead.  I am glad I did. The bag has enough room in the main compartment for my camera with the 18-55 lens attached and also the 70-300 VR lens.  The ability to carry it as a shoulder bag or around my waist is great!  I am leaving the two side lens cases detacted for now until I have more lens.  BTW, the 70-300 VR lens will fit in the side canisters, although it is snug. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I would make storing the waist straps better."

I wanted something that would let me get the camera in and out quickly for casual walking around use with the family. Bag has good capacity and solid construction.  I use it with a Canon 40D and a couple smallish lenses.  A 50mm and a 17-85mm zoom, couple of filters, extra cards, and batteries.  Plenty of capacity to throw in a wide angle if I get one sometime.  I took off the side cases and don't use them.  They're too small for my larger lenses, but even if they were bigger I think you start pushing the limits of using a belt pouch once you start throwing in 2 and 3 pound lenses along with a camera.  I may attach one for a water bottle at some point, and for those that don't mind carrying extra weight, there are larger attachable side cases available from Lowepro. There's a detachable shoulder strap I don't find it useful at all.  I can't make it fit well or comfortably. For carrying heavier lenses like a 400/5.6 or 150/2.8 macro I go with a backpack.  While you could really load the Off Road up with a lot of gear if you buy some larger side lense cases I think it starts to get pretty awkward with stuff that won't fit in the supplied bag and side cases."

Good for a good size body three professional zooms and a medium flash. Wish the lense pouch is slightly wider for my 24-70L lense, and bag itself is a inch deeper for the 70-200L on the body. Highly recommend."

As far as the side bags being to small, lowepro does make different size pouchs that can be added in place of the two that come with it.  I have attached a water bottle pouch to one side of the bag.  But as I said, it does hold a 70-300mm in those pouches. This bag also does have two rings on it that you can attach a regular shoulder strap with. I have had this bag for about 10 years, I do a fair amount of hiking and snowshoeing, and it is the only bag that I have found that is really good for that."
653524,A1GDS6RWL2NYVH,0,1,10,B0000AE6C6,8/1/2007,5,6,6,Good for non-pro SLR and lenses,"This has been my main bag for a long time. I have a Canon 20D with the kit lens (18-55), 28-135mm, a 430 flash, and a bottle of water between the main compartment and the 2 side cans. This still leaves plenty of room in the front compartment for additional cards, batteries, filters, and stuff. However, when I added the battery grip, the camera was too wide to fit in the bag.  My 77mm ""L"" lenses are a tight squeeze into the cans even without the lens hoods. Fully loaded, the bag can get pretty heavy and pretty awkward to wear around my waist.  I have run with it, but I often feel like I might need a bigger butt to help support it.  I think that this is about as big a bag I can ever wear around my 33"" waist.  I usually just sling in over my shoulder with the nice padded shoulder harness. I give it a 5 because for what it is, the bag is very good.  I've dragged it to many places and the bag is still in very good condition.  Zippers are smooth and don't catch. The material is very strong and I am confident about the cushioning the bag provides. When wearing around my waist I cannot feel the contents of the bag when I'm walking or bending over because the cushioning is good. The waist strap is thick and comfortable but can be tucked inside a sleeve in the back when I'm just using the harness.  I also like that I can just click the bag closed when I don't want to have to zip up the camera compartment."
653525,AESPLVBQJCNC7,0,1,11,B0000AE6C6,1/21/2008,5,8,8,Truly Awesome Design to Minimize Low Back Strain and for Maximum Freedom While Carrying Equipment,"This bag is absolutely perfect for what I wanted in a camera bag.  My priorities for a camera bag were for most of the weight to be placed at my waist so that there would be less downward force on my lumbar spine.  The weight would exert downward pressure starting below my low back which is ideal when carrying heavy equipment.  This is extremely important for anybody who already experiences low back pain or is interested in preserving for as long as possible the health of the lumber intervertebral discs and lumbar facet joints (which will become arthritic with time and spinal axial loading).  I also wanted the bag to be easily accessible while walking or on-the-fly.  I wanted to have maximum freedom while holding my camera or just being able to use my arms freely while carrying the camera in the bag. Traditional backpacks and the single-strap Lowepro Slingshot backpacks place the weight of the bag onto your lumbar spine and so these were out of the question.  If you ever carry heavy equipment, you'll understand how important it is to have the weight start its force below, rather than above the low back.  These backpacks also do not give as much freedom on-the-fly as a waist pack or fanny bag like the Lowepro Off Road.  Even the Slingshot bag with its single strap is not nearly as convenient to use on-the-fly as you have to spin that bag around and then spin it back. So packs that are tied to the waist or ""fanny packs"" are the best at preserving the health of one's low back, and also the best for on-the-fly use.  However, have you ever tried to carry a traditional fanny pack with 10-15 lbs of weight?  Well, it can be done, and the Lowepro Off Road will let you use the bag purely as a fanny pack.  It will, however, look odd and bounce as you walk.  I'm 5' 8"" and 150 lbs and it feels somewhat large but manageable when used as purely a fanny pack.  You will certainly get some stares from others who see this large luggage hanging from you. However, the beauty of this bag is that it is actually probably better when NOT used as a pure fanny or waist pack.  I have this bag on tied to my waist with the really easy, large, and durable waist clips.  About 90% of the weight is attached to my hips and so my low back is spared.  The other 10% of the load is off-set by my using the included comfortable shoulder strap.  Using the bag in this manner with both the waist strap and the shoulder strap may sound odd, but in fact it accomplishes 2 things: The bag no longer looks odd.  It looks like you're carrying a regular, handsome and sporty bag with a shoulder strap that also happens to have waist support.  But the bag no longer appears to be an odd, oversized fanny pack, but an acceptable and handsome shoulder bag.  Yet, because of the waist support, you get all of the conveniences of the fanny pack, including lower lumbar spine strain reduction and ultimate freedom to use both your arms without having a conventional shoulder bag fall off. The other purpose of using the shoulder strap with the waist strap besides making the bag look conventionally handsome, is that it does provide some support while you walk or run.  Without the shoulder strap, the fanny bag would bounce up and down quite a bit.  Again, I'm 5' 8"" and medium build.  If you're significantly taller and heavier, the bag may not bounce as much and may not look as odd without the shoulder strap. I can load and unload the bag on-the-fly without stopping.  My camera equipment is available easily whenever I need it quickly and my arms are free.  I own a Nikon D40X with an 18-135mm and SB-600 external flash which fit easily in the main compartment with a lot of room to spare.  There are probably still 3 inches of room in front of the mounted 18-135 mm lens on the body.  There is even space still left over in the main boxy compartment to fit my Sony HDR-SR7 high definition hard-drive video camera!  On each side of the main box-like compartment, you have 2 more cylindrical containers which are also removal and can be replaced with other modules from Lowepro. The build quality is excellent and the design is truly unique as I was not able to find any other design similar to this.  This is such a well-designed bag that truly takes into consideration all of the priorities I listed: low back-sparing design with waist straps, ability to have the camera available without stopping to remove a backpack or even rotate/spin a Slingshot, and the ability to make what would normally be an odd-looking large fannypack transformed into a handsome shoulder bag in disguise (since it really still functions as a fanny bag). I cannot recommend this bag highly enough.  Even if you don't experience chronic low back pain, I think this bag is very important in helping you get as much mileage out of your low back before you develop osteoarthritis of your lumbar spine (which will inevitably occur as we all age)."
653526,A15RYTNK30XJ7R,0,1,12,B0000AE6C6,2/15/2006,5,47,47,Most Used SLR Bag,"For any kind of photography that does not involve the use of either extremely large lenses, or more than 3 total lenses, this is the ideal camera bag.  I reach for it more often than any other pack I own, including very high quality backpacks like the Tamrac Expedition 5.  With the hip pack/shoulder bag combination, you can easily access all of your gear while walking, not even needing to stop, and all of it is upright and will not fall out.  You are not forced to set anything down on dirty surfaces and can reach for gear with one hand.  For longer pack trips, such a bag is also very easily placed inside a standard backpack, which is again difficult w/ larger models.  I highly recommend this bag, or other similar types from Tamrac, if your normal activities meet the above conditions.  If you often utilize super telephoto lenses or are a photographer who finds joy in carrying around a vast array of lenses, this one will be too small.  Most of my pictures are taken w/ a Nikon D70s, and either a Nikkor 18-200 mm AF-S VR zoom or my wide-angle 12-24 mm for landscapes.  This bag easily carries these, all accessories, and an additional lens such as an 80-400 mm zoom.  Resist any temptations you might have to go with a backpack.  The reason for this is simple logistics. It turns out that in terms of carrying a camera, a backpack is just about the most difficult apparatus to use efficiently. In order to access your SLR, you must essentially remove the pack and place it on the ground. This is then followed by accessing your camera, which generally has to be set down in order for you to re-shoulder the bag. Quite an unpleasant, time consuming and burdensome process especially when the ground is covered in snow or mud.  Go with a LowePro or Tamrac hip pack/shoulder bag like this one."

I considered, the following: - iRiver - although the reviews are very good, it looks too clunky and industrial for me - Olympus M:robe - looked good but a bit expensive and the reviews were rather disheartening - iPods - great reviews but expensive (though it's gone down considerably since I bought this), not to mention abundant - it's enough to make me scream, ""bring back originality, please!"" So I aimed for iAudio; I'd never heard of it before but the reviews in Amazon raised my interest. Although the M3 looked great, fumbling around in my bag for earphones and a remote didn't appeal to me. Then I came across the X5. The reviews were incredible but I didn't want to have to pay for the Video or Photo capabilities. Watching music videos on my computer is so insufficient (ever notice how plasma screens are getting bigger not smaller?) so I for one cannot understand why doing this on an even smaller screen is what's driving the market for mp3 players today. So, what I really wanted was something between the iAudio X5 and iAudio M3. Hello M5! - The sound is astounding that I now rarely reach for my B&O earphones (even my friends who own iPods and Creative Zens agree with me on this) - there's no need to install a driver (very good for those who seldom use computers and want things to be as simple as possible) - no need to fork out more money for a USB micro-drive when this works as a separate hard-drive - voice-recording is excellent for meetings and lectures (you can even set the bit rate for it) - in-line recording - I can connect it to my Cable TV and record the music channels to my iAudio - play-time goes beyond 14 hours - available upgrades of firmware and software for the player itself, JetAudio, LDB Manager and Jetshell - it supports ID3 tagging but doesn't organize music this way; it does it through a folder-structure style (so if you like viewing your music via artist, album, genre, etc, then you may find this irritating) - it has pre-set equalizer settings or you can set it to your own preferences too - and the best thing is that this doesn't lessen the life of the battery - file transfer is FAST - you can read lyrics while listening to the music - my favorite feature! About the Lyrics, I initially thought 2 things: - Since I've previously tagged my mp3 files I thought reading lyrics was just a matter of uploading song files into my M5 and nothing more - I could then use the M5's 'joystick' to scroll through the lyrics I was wrong. Lyrics need to be loaded using Cowon's LDB (lyrics database) program (which you can download from http://eng.iaudio.com). This can be done either automatically (you click a button and it searches through the server) or manually (for unpopular or non-English songs, you can add lyrics yourself). The way it works is that the player itself scrolls through the song without any action from the user. Although this is quite a cool function, it also means that for manually loaded lyrics (which is for most songs by the way), you will need to sit in front of your PC, use LDB, then periodically press the ""Set Sync"" button to specify the timing for each line of the song. This is EXTREMELY TEDIOUS for most, but since I actually love reading lyrics and I'm very particular when it comes to tagging my songs (I even fill in the Biography tab of my mp3 files), this isn't much of a step away from the amount of time I spend on tagging my files so it suits me perfectly! PS: the manual doesn't cover how to load lyrics to files so go to http://eng.iaudio.com, then click on Support > FAQ and search ""How to use LDB Manager"" to find out how the program works. My only gripe is that the carrying case is sold separately (unlike Creative Zen where it's included in the package) and only comes in one colour and style (kudos to iPod for having so many to choose from). You can however go to www.noreve.com for optional cases however this can set you back a fair bit so until such time when iAudio can provide more of these cases, my `iPaq' case will have to suffice. It may not have as recognizable a look as iPod, but with its amazing sound, countless features and long battery life, you realize IT'S ALSO COOL TO BE DIFFERENT!"

USB OTG - connects digital camera directly to transfer photos. 3. Plays Video/Picture Viewer. 4. Battery Life - Claims to be 35 hours for this model but it depends on the use. For my use: 3 - 4 hours of listening per day I charge it once or twice a week. It never died on me. 5. Text/Lyrics feature. 6. Upgradable Firmware. 7. Strong built/Scratch Resistant. 8. Timer/Alarm/Clock 9. No software, you can drag and drop files. ( It comes with software which you can use) Things I didn't like: 1. No ID3 Tag support YET!!! 2. Subpack which is a little attachment which comes with the player to charge it, connect to pc and Auxin-out. I wish this was  built in.

I have used the Magellan 700 to get from point A to point B.  When it works (actually powers on), it will do the job.  However, so will just about every other NAV unit on the market. The problem is, when your unit fails (and ours did three times withing the first year), you will deal with the worst customer service on the planet! Our unit broke within 30 days of purchase.  The unit's power would simply shut off while driving down the road (and right when you need it the most!).  Sometimes, the unit would not even power up from the start.  It also would search for the satellite and often lose our location.  We tried changing car power adapters, etc. but no go.  Fortunately, the first time this happened, we were still within 30 days of purchase, so Amazon was nice enough to send us a replacement unit.  However, when the unit would not power on for the second and third time (a few months later), we had to send it back to Magellan. When you call Magellan, you speak with a customer service rep in India!   Every sigle phone number that you dial is routed to India!   Unfortunately, they have no clue how to help you.  To send your unit back for repair, you need to wait for an email with shipping instructions.  The problem is, that never comes!  In my case, I called them 7 times over the course of 10 days trying to get my shipping instructions and RMA.  I begged them for an address and RMA number via phone so I could send it back (and I offered to pay for the shipping), but they will not give it to me.  Each time I called, I was told that I would receive the email within 24 hrs.....but nothing ever shows up.  I even gave them alternative emails to send to...but nothing. Amazingly, you cannot even speak to a supervisor to resolve your problems or anyone in the US for that matter.  You are simply stuck in an endless loop! As I sit here today, I am holding my broken Magellan.....waiting for an email that probably will never come.  My warrantee is quickly running out and I am blindly finding my way around town. Please....I beg you to consider a Garmin or a different brand NAV....don't buy anything from Magellan!!!  When this thing works, it's fine.  But if it breaks (and it likely will), then good luck getting it fixed! You have been warned!!"

For most people, that's either Chessbase or Chess Assistant. Chess Assistant is a great tool that will do pretty much anything you can think of, and then some. It allows you to organize your own games, gives you access to its own database of almost three million games, a database of a quarter of a million correspondence games, and free updates to games through their website. You can also easily convert other formated databases to the Chess Assistant format. You also get to play online through their own server for free. The benifits of the program are too many to mention. Data manipulation, study tools, analysis tools, opening encyclopedia, you name it, it probably has it. Suffice it to say that it is an excellent value for the price. A couple of the only qualms I have are 1) playing against the engine isn't that fun (stick with Fritz for that), and 2) it doesn't have as slick an interface as Chessbase. However, considering the price difference, I think it does its job just fine. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comprehensive analysis tool that can't afford Chessbase's prices."

Any designer -- whether web or print -- has at least a few of the applications in this suite. You only need to decide if the price is right, and if your current upgrades would make the purchase worthwhile. Buying this suite is the equivalent of a corporate employee owning Microsoft Office. Adobe's name now equals design software. Knowing Adobe's product line is simply required knowledge. Print houses will accept and produce your files without problems, and multiplatform file transfer can be completed with minimum processing time. For me, I was using a dated version of Illustrator, PageMaker 6.5, Photoshop Elements. The additional programs and new versions of what I had made the purchase a no-brainer. I also primarily use Dreamweaver, but learning GoLive will help me as I meet with clients. Outside of InDesign and GoLive, every application here is the industry standard, and those two programs are strongly coming into their own. To explain the virtues of each individual application is not necessary. You know the benefits of Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat, and GoLive. InDesign might be new to some of the veterans, but it is beyond a replacement for the inferior PageMaker, and is a force of its own. With the quality increase of InDesign, designers are now able to choose something besides Quark for their page layout application. Including InDesign here made the purchase for me easy. I have no reason now to piecemeal together my software base. Each application has all of the features that they have when independently purchased. I fully recommend ""Adobe Creative Suites Premium."" Designers need these apps, and so your decision is only about price and value. Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.com"

If you are a trained ear and listen to classical music now and then you're able to notice the lack of accurate sound in the midrange frequencies. Since many pc users will be playing music cd's or mp3s on their systems just as well as games or DVD's, the standard should be put for both use. The subwoofer of the 550 Megaworks is predominantly present when playing audio cd's and cannot be tuned to an acceptable level by either the 550's remote control or audio card sound controls (I own an Audigy 2 ZS from Creative). Although 2-way satellite speakers enclosed with the Gigaworks S750 or Klipsch Promedia 5.1 Ultra might do a better job, I seriously doubt whether you can ever get the same performance like you have on the average home theater set from Sony or any other manufacturer. Cables delivered with the 550 have unshielded copper and can easily transfer noise. So actually, you have to re-wire the 550 from the start with better quality cables. All in all, very disappointing in view of the price you have to pay for 5.1 or 7.1 speakers such as these."
