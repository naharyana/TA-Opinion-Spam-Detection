535686,A1BNLDFB61V0OP,0,1,38,B000BYGFYU,2/4/2007,2,44,49,"A large-capacity, comfortable backpack for Macs that doesn't provide as much protection as it should","A 17"" Mac Book Pro or Powerbook fits nicely in this backpack, and there's plenty of extra room for the power supply, spare batteries, cables, thumb drives, EVDO cards, etc. Brenthaven changed the design a few months ago.  My wife has an earlier one, which has a less comfortable handle but a removable inner sleeve that velcros closed. The newer style does not have the internal velcro closure, and this was a very costly omission for me.  My backpack, containing my 17"" Powerbook, tipped over, fully zipped, and fell approximately two feet to the floor, with the top of the backpack striking pavement. Fearing the worst but hoping for the best, I removed the computer and was horrified to discover that it had slid right through the internal flap and taken the full brunt of the impact, massively denting and dislocating the side of the computer and damaging the PCMCIA slot. Applecare does not cover this sort of damage, so I ended up eating a multi-hundred dollar repair bill. The backpack is comfortable and capacious, but the lack of protection for a top impact was a deep disappointment."
535986,A2HZR1YZ581U72,0,1,82,B000BY9A3I,8/9/2008,3,11,12,Dirt Devil 082700 Vacuum,"Although this vacuum has great suction, I do have some observations to make.  First, if you have stairs, I don't recommend this one.  It ends up falling down the stairs every time you move.  It's too wide to sit on the wheels, and standing up, it is top heavy, so it tips over.  The second thing is that the attachments are supposed to attach to the body and handle.  If you try to do that, they fall off, or worse, break off.  It may be a good concept, but in practice, it just doesn't work.  Thirdly, the wand does not attach to the handle, and the attachments do not attach to the handle or wand.  They just push on.  When they decide to fall apart, watch out.  When they hit your feet, it hurts!!!  Now, here is the biggie.  The fourth problem I found has to do with pet hair.  If you use the beater brush attachment, and you have dogs or cats, you will only use it once, as the hair gets tangled around the beater bar and the wheels, rendering it useless, until you take it apart and pull all the hairs out.  So you will probably end up using the other wide attachment.  The fifth problem is that this attachment swivels in all different directions, but it doesn't return to center.  Every time you hit a furniture leg, the attachment swivels.  Now it doesn't sit flat on the floor, and you have to straighten it with your hand.  If you have a temper, you will be taking this one apart, too, to fix it after you slam it on the floor a couple of times. Again, I will say that it has great suction.  The high pitched squeal seems to be common to this type of vacuum, and if you are close to the cleaner, it probably won't bother you, but other people tend to get very irritated with it. It is evident to me that Dirt Devil built what they thought was a great vacuum, but they didn't bother to have it tested in the real world.  Relying on their reputation, they get your money.  Will I buy another Dirt Devil product?  Not likely."

I had to check the title a couple of times to make sure this was the same adapter i bought because everyone reviewing this item seems so negative about it??? I think the sound quality is def equal to that of a cd! which was our big problem with the iTrip - which we wanted to like, but....The reason i was on amazon.com looking and only gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars was that the white doesn't match our car and i don't want it to stand out as someone else has said as something to make a potential break in happen....And as far as the cassette controls working - i didn't even know that it did that, but if it works that will be a bonus! none of the other fm transmitters do that! I would def. recommend buying this ipod accessory AND if that changes in the next week, month, etc... i will come change this review! ps...my husband is very opinionated about the sound quality of his music and was ready to return the whole thing after listening to the ipod over the iTrip connection!  Hope this helps... pps...just noticed that the title says 'dock connector' but the picture doesn't show a dock connection but a jack????"

558215,A2KMTKKOFFY9RQ,0,1,37,B0009U7Y0U,3/6/2006,4,7,7,Amazon Rocks,"A lot of the reason I am so pleased with the Mac Mini has to do with Amazon.com.  Great customer service, price, shipping.  Buying this from the Apple store would have cost me $150 more.  Now, about the computer- First off, I was shipped a unit with upgraded Processor (1.5ghz) and Video.  Also the Superdrive is dual layer, not single although I haven't been able to see if it works as a DL.  So I'm pretty pleased that I have an upgrade right off the bat. The slogan says BYODKM, so I'll tell you how I have it set up.  Apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse and the display is a 50' plasma TV.  This is a really cool setup for my kids, playing educational games. About 2 days after the unit was delivered, Apple released the new Intel version of the Mini.  Initially I was disappointed, but after looking at the new specs I realized I had bought the better PPC version.  The Intel version shares video with the 512 main memory and has no dedicated chipset seperate. The positives are: Small form factor, great performance, price.  You just can't beat OS X in terms of reliability.  I will not miss being a system administrator on my wife's dell, constantly scanning and removing malware.  Price-Got mine with a superdrive for $630 shipped. Negatives:  Memory.  Although units shipping now have a standard 512k, I really think I'll need to upgrade to at least 1mb.  Also, after having been a Powerbook user, there is a perceptable difference in the build quality.  Not bad mind you, but not quite up to par with the Powerbooks. Overall, a great machine if you already have your keyboard/mouse/display.  If not, the new imac is a much better value.  Why only 4 instead of 5 stars? Well, the superdrive seems to only want to burn at 2X, not the 8X as advertised.  Apple has nothing to remedy this issue yet, but will probably issue a firmware upgrade sometime. So my advice is to take the plunge and switch over to OS X, you'll be very happy you did."
564834,A19ZADXHKBXHVW,0,1,2,B0009A2LP8,1/7/2006,4,4,7,Almost a great product,"Although this unit has a front DV input, it only has basic interoperability with my Sony camcorder--the DV tape cannot be controlled from the Samsung remote as is possible with a computer/camcorder link, and to my knowledge this unit can't record widescreen footage properly (it's interpreted as fullscreen and appears squished). On the other hand, my dad, a non-technophile, was able to figure it out, and as he does not share my anguish over the widescreen issue, I'm forced to recommend it for basic uses. It does have sane defaults, like an auto-chaptering feature (which may need to be turned on) that inserts new chapters every 5 minutes and handles all the menu creation."
565389,ALJ69YTMIMYPM,0,1,12,B00095LILQ,8/29/2008,5,0,0,Does the job well!,I bought this for the Red Castle Whizz (not the BOB stroller) and it works wonderfully. It fits perfect on the handle and holds water bottles as well as regular sized drink cups. Seems to be very well made and should definitely last for the life of the stroller. It also folds with the stroller with no issues. I've heard it works well on most strollers with similar handles.

It sounds more like a $19.99 boom box and the music sounds flat, even if you put it on one of the enhanced modes.  In the radio FM mode I can only pick up a few stations and even those do not come in clear.  I am using the antenna that came with the stereo.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, good looking, space saving, system that is capable of playing your MP3's this might fit the bill if sound is not your primary concern.  If you are looking for clear, crisp sounds, with deep base and x-base, you would be better off spending a little more and getting a higher quality player. Personally, if I had heard this mini-system before purchasing it, I wouldn't have bought it."

The balance between mids and highs is wonderful, and the subwoofer... all I can say is WOW! This purchase was a shot in the dark for me. The system I originally wanted was discontinued.  I was browsing for alternatives and thankfully, I stumbled on this system by Klipsch, a brand I had never heard of.  I could only find 3 reviews on the GMX A-2.1, but all were EXTREMELY positive, so I decided to give it a try.  I couldn't be happier!! The sound is truly unbelieveable...worth every penny."

The GMX system is a worthy product in the incredible line of Klipsch speakers, which have always been the class of the world. I bought these directly from Klipsch. I was surprised at the weight of the package, most of it coming from the powered subwoofer. All of the other reviews praise the sound quality, and they are correct. These are incredible speakers! The aesthetics were one of the reasons I selected these over the more traditional alternative. They have a very high-tech look that is matched by their performance."
653444,A84U8KUTWVNJZ,0,1,32,B0000AE82C,7/8/2004,5,0,0,"Solid speakers, great deal from Amazon.com","Let me start off by establishing just a bit of credibility.  I am a professional video editor with over 25 years of experience in dealing with professional audio and video equipment, and a picky discerning listener who can tell the difference between clean audio and not-so-clean audio. And I don't work for Klipsch. I've owned this system for nearly 3 years, and it has performed flawlessly. I don't undestand all the fuss from others about a constant hiss. It's overhyped, and frankly, I have to hold my ear to the satellite speaker and hope for perfect silence in the room for me to even begin to notice the hiss (and I'm not deaf) .... don't believe the exaggerations. I have connected a DVD player, my Apple G5, and my Apple Airport Express to these speakers, and everything sounds terrific. The Klipsch GMX-A 2.1 system clearly and faithfully reproduces the full audible spectrum, and gives you control over master volume and sub-woofer volume. The control pod has a headphone jack, RCA-type line inputs, and a stereo mini input as well, your choice. Actually, you can have both audio sources plugged in at the same time, a thing of beauty. The system is powerful and efficient, but to tell you the truth, the satellites are ugly. The latter being the only sacrifice for the great sound it reproduces, and not bad enough to deduct one star in the rating. Not that a plain black box looks any better, it's a subjective thing. When it comes to speakers, my priority is my ears, not my eyes. Don't just think of this system as ""multimedia"" computer speakers, they're much more than that. I'm planning on purchasing a second system to use with my new HDTV. It's not being marketed that way, but it seems unnecessary to me to own an amplifier, plus speakers, when you can have this powered all-in-one system instead. Remember, it's a ""2.1"" system, meaning 2 satellite speakers and 1 sub-woofer, so you won't be listening to true surround sound. But the day Klipsch sells a 5.1 system with wireless rear speakers, I'm in. Until then, it's good-ol' stereo for me. Amazon.com is a great place to purchase these (where I got mine)... it's a HEAVY package, and free shipping is an amazingly good deal. Good luck!"

I was ready to give up and I heard about these.  These sound better than my Boston Acoustics and JBL's.  No kidding. If listening to music is your primary use and you want a great tonal response and outstanding spatial imaging look no further. Complaints I've had to move my speaker wires and replace the RCA connector and cable supplied.  It is too low-quality for these speakers.  The speaker and headphone levels need to be better balanced. For all those who have some hiss it just may be your set-up.  My PC had an audio connector that was going bad.

They're solid and well made with bright, clear tweeters (from mb-quart) and a powerful subwoofer.  They also look great. Their weak point is the midrange, where most music actually is reproduced.  The two-inch mid doesn't do a bad job, but it definitely seems edgy and distorted compared with my other computer speakers (from monsoon, a/d/s/, and nakamichi).  Vocals suffer especially, with a fatiguing, unnatural edge to every sibilant.  But you could make the case that none of my other three pairs of computer speakers is currently available, so maybe this is the best sounding pair of computer speakers you can buy this side of eBay."

They rock. I haven't the hiss others have reported. Guess I got a good set. The sub-whoofer blows the walls, ceilings, etc. out. The only draw back for me are the aesthetics of the high-mid range turbine-like pods. Kind of remind me of a bad set detail from that horrible Jude Law / Gwyneth Paletrow - Flash Gordon/Fritz Lang inspired film of last year. They are just plain U-G-L-Y, but well enough designed with lil' rubber feet which grab nicely (thank god) to tight high spots on bookshelves out of the line of sight. The Whoofer is the customary black box. Again - for $150 - a great value."

If you want to buy these speakers for music purpuses and I mean loud music with alot of Bass, dont get these speakers get the THX by Klipsch they are the same price and are defiently better at piccking up lows and have a good abss response. I have tested both and the THX just outperforms the GMX with less distortions. Now if you want a good 2.1 Speaker set for connecting to s dvd player or video game console buy these speakers! They work well, This is the main reason I bought these speakers because the THX dont hook up to video game consoles, so my opion is if you want speakers for the strict use of listening to music defiently buy the THX they are so much better for heavy bass and are the same price."

The small mids & tweeters are packaged very well and sit nicely on most surfaces. I find the added ability of rotation some what stiff but still a nice feature. The system can be played at almost max volume with very little distortion. I play allot of Techno music and find that this system brings out all those sounds I was missing with my last system. The satellite controller is nice and very responsive to slight knob turning, I still have not turned the bass more than half way for fear my windows will break! It is truly unbelievable how much great sound comes out of this set up and for such a good price.

I like the desktop controls because, if I'm listening later in the evening, I can cut the bass a bit and lower the volume so I don't disturb anyone. I had a set of Harman/Kardons and a set of Dell 5.1's that both were mediocre at best. The Klipsch are well worth the investment!"

I have to be honest with you.  I almost canceled the order after reading so many negative comments on a ""hissing"" problem these speakers have.  There is NO HISS!  The only thing I can think of is that the manual clearly indicates that only the satellites are shielded.  The sub-woofer is not and must be at least 10 inches from your monitor to prevent interference.  Follow the instructions and I'm sure you will agree that these are one of the best speaker systems out there right now."

They are by far, the most powerful 2.1 speakers on the market.  They are more expensive then the rest, but its worth it.  And as for the hissing sound, Ive been using these daily for 5 months and never ran into that problem.  Im a freshmen at Drexel University, and these blow away everyone else's computer speakers and home audio in the dorm.  People actually peek in and cant believe such small speakers and woofer can be heard across the building.  I would strongly suggest buying this pair of Klipsch speakers."

Certainly not a techie or audiophile! A friend recommended Klipsch so this is what I bought. They're pretty easy to set up--the instructions are clear--and I think they sound great! To get what amounts to a new sound system at this price seems like a good deal to me. At first I heard no trace of the dreaded hiss or hum--and my ears are pretty sharp. But after a few days I realized that when the computer is completely shut down I could hear the barest trace of a hiss coming from the speakers. But when the computer is on the slight noise is completely drowned out by the normal hum of the computer and monitor. And when the computer is completely shut off I'm usually not close enough to hear the hiss at all. How one figures out in advance if it's going to bother you or not I don't know. But for me these speakers are a 5 so far.
653461,AWCKAFY8D9UUL,0,0,49,B0000AE82C,12/25/2003,5,9,9,"AWESOME PRODUCT, despite a couple of flaws","Let's start with the flaws.  Firstly, as one reviewer stated before there is a slight hiss which comes from the speakers, possibly this has to do with individual electrical outlets, power strips, or interference.  Nevertheless it is quite minor in my opinion.  Secondly, at VERY low volumes one speaker is louder than the other.  Again, to many this may not be even noticeable, and at normal listening levels, the problem appears not to be present. OKAY, now for the positives, which I must stress strongly outweigh the negatives.  The sound of the system is startling, honestly I was shocked when hearing it for the first time, considering the price especially.  What has to be considered is that there may be some minor flaws in system which has this type of power and sound quality at this price point, but I repeat that the positives strongly outweigh the negatives.  Lastly, the system build is very nice, heavy nice material, can be installed in a matter of minutes.  I highly recommend this product, I am not sure what else you can get out there given the price/performance ratio."
653462,A2ORWXJ7TU9H7P,0,1,50,B0000AE82C,11/2/2006,5,9,9,Know what to expect,"I have a rather strong background in home theater, of which I will spare you the details of to say, ""It has been a while."" A lot of people seem to have different ideas of just what $100-$150 buys when it comes to speaker systems.  I must admit I find the reviewers that seem to hold this particular system to the standard of world class audio components are  also going to have a hard time dealing with the fact that a Nissan cannot hold it's own on the track against a Ferrari.  If you are looking for the ultimate in a musical or soundtrack reproduction experience, look else where.  By that I mean do not look to a 2.1 speaker setup.  These speakers are excellent, are very easy to setup and adjust to suit your tastes, and do just about as good a job with sound reproduction as one could expect when dealing with a setup this size with ""out-of-the-box"" cables.  The hiss issue I read so much about is absent, but I run my computer with a grounded outlet and voltage regulator. I am happy Klipsch has a few offerings that fall below the $190 mark.  They are accurate, convenient, and most strongly recommended as a COMPUTER SPEAKER setup.  Oh yes, and I am very happy with what my $100 buys."
653463,A2EUVEQORWIPFT,0,0,51,B0000AE82C,12/14/2006,4,13,13,Very solid.,"I purchased Klipsch ProMedia GMX-A 2.1 speakers as a gift for my girlfriend to put in her rather small apartment (less than 500 square feet).  After hooking them up to her TV, I found myself pleasantly surprised, given that these days Klipsch, like Bose, is among the most over-hyped names in sound. THE GOOD: Set up was very easy.  The control module, while not wireless, has a good selection of inputs, which is the main reason I chose these over the older, THX ProMedias; I connected her TV via RCA cables and her iPod via a 1/8"" input simultaneously.  The sound, while not as deafeningly loud as every other review seems to claim, is quite clear and sharp.  With the subwoofer level set to about 35 percent, there is more than enough low-end to satisfy anyone.  The speakers' style, a take-it-or-leave it industrial design, actually match the colors of her TV also, making the whole ensemble quite subtle and attractive. THE BAD: Several users made mention of a static ""hissing"" noise coming out of the speakers, specifically the tweeters.  These seems to be an affliction across the line, as these ones suffer from it also.  That said, it is only noticeable when one is extremely close to the speakers, such as when your ear is right next to it.  And once music is playing, it's not noticeable at all.  What's interesting is that my Bose Companion3 speakers that I use for my laptop when I visit my parents' house has the same hiss.  Finally, the mid-range is not the greatest with these speakers, but quite frankly, that's to be expected with satellite/subwoofer systems that lack mid-sized cones. THE VERDICT: At under $150 including shipping, these speakers work extremely well for filling small rooms with crisp, clear, strong sound.  They won't strip paint at high volumes, but don't seem prone to distortion either.  They are certainly more balanced and sharper than the aforementioned Bose Companion3s, and cost some $100 less.  If you're looking at 2.1 set ups for a small room or apartment, I daresay you can't do much better than this (at least at this price), and if you can, I haven't heard it yet."
653465,A2BMZRO0H7TFCS,0,0,53,B0000AE82C,12/10/2003,3,174,210,Here's a devil's advocate review for your pleasure,"I was very close to purchasing these speakers from reading just the reviews on Amazon and on the brand reputation of Klipsch.  I wanted to see if I could upgrade from my Bose MediaMate speakers for just a little more money.  But I have firmly decided against the Klipsch.  Read on for my personal reasoning. PRO'S - Great sound - Plenty of input options - Convenient control module CON's - Continuous buzzing/hissing noise - Love it or hate it looks PERFORMANCE From every specification I've read and every review I've read, these speakers DO sound amazing.  1/3 of the volume limit is about what most people max out at before they begin to wonder whether they'll upset their neighbors or cause their picture frames to go flying off the walls.  This aspect of these speakers are what brought me to seriously consider them and I have no doubt that they are probably some of the best sounding 2.1 speakers you can buy, and at a semi-reasonable amount of money. FEATURES Wow, inputs galore and a very attractive looking control module, unlike those from Creative Labs and Logitech.  Should you desire, you can also purchase matching speaker stands for the GMX line.  A very flexible set of speakers for use with your PC, game system, or portable audio device. AESTHETICS Arguably, the ugliest speakers I've ever seen.  I think some people really appreciate the industrial look of these speakers, but I prefer something more elegant and simple. INTANGIBLES So here is why I decided not to spend my hard earned dollars.  There is a constant HISS that resonates from the speakers that you cannot get rid of.  This hiss exists also in the 5.1 version of the GMX and if you do some more research, you'll read plenty of people who have purchased this set and that is their primary complaint.  I don't want my speakers to hiss/buzz.  I only want to hear Eddie Van Halen's amazing guitar work, Freddie Mercury's tremendous vocal range, DJ Tiesto's bouncing beats, and my MONSTER KILLS on Unreal Tournament. SUMMARY I thought Amazon shoppers might appreciate the research I've done with these speakers and get a devil's advocate review.  I for one, always like to read the reviews of those who didn't like a product more, because it's the picky people who will tell you something about a product you won't know from reading a feature list on the box.  I gave the speakers 3 stars, which means I think they are ""OK.""  I am much happier with the value of my Logitech Z-2300's.  The average rating on both sets are 4.5, but the Logitech's have 816 customer reviews, while the Klipsch have only 53.  The masses have spoken."

I thought it was defective until I fiddled around with it, rotating the holder 90 degrees and found out it will snap in.  There's a rivet nearby and maybe the rivet is preventing the holder from snapping in in the upright position.
