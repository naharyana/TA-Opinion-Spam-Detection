After struggling with crashes and extremely slow speed (e.g., 60+ seconds to launch Word) and spending hours on the phone with various tech support reps, all the while thinking it was a problem with the brand new Dell or Windows XP, we encountered an error message that would pop up upon shut down. It indicated a problem with the file SDII.exe. I did a quick Google search and discovered that SDII.exe is a file that the Microtek software installs and launches on startup. The file has a known bug that causes it to hog most of your processing power and RAM. I checked the Task Manager, and sure enough, SDII.exe was there, consuming 99% of the CPU. Since that file is only necessary if you use the scanner's one-touch keys, I disabled the file, and we had our computer back."

These connectors make the strollers too wide to fit through even doors accessible to wheelchairs.  The stroller's wheels get all hung up on one another in the middle every time you make a turn.

The only problem we have had is with the cornors.  2 of the 4 have come off in 5 months time, which isn't too bad.  My son pulled one off and the other one came off because with getting up and down from the couch we bumped it a lot and it came off.  Rest of it has stuck great, but we make sure we keep little hands from pulling it off!  One thing we were worried about was the finish on our coffee table, but the tape is great and doesn't take any of the finish off, which makes us feel a lot better!  Still better then the ones that have elastic in them, those are very easy to take off, but I wish this product would either come with stickier tape, or extra tape!"

It stays on through the wash (at least for 25 times), is easy to put into clothing and is not scratchy. I put my home and cell phone number on the inside tongue of my kids shoes (since they wear shoes every day and do not have that many pairs it means they always have the info). If they are separated from me they have the numbers so I can be reached.   I used to try to write it with a sharpie, but it is often tough to find enough ""blank space"" to write a legible phone number.  In fact, I used to write my phone number ON my kids with a sharpie when we would go to say, an amusement park, but this is less embarrassing for all. Most of the time I iron it onto the label tag.

It syncrhonizes  with my desktop and laptop, stores notes, gives quick access to my roladex  and with the modem attachment allows me to get my email.  I can even put  games on the Palm 3X for when I get bored in meetings.I found learning to  write graffiti was intuitive and easy but my friends found the keyboard  attachment helpful.

It is not only the built in applications which make my life easier, but the thousands of 3rd party applications available for free or next to  nothing on the internet, which expand the use of my palm to something I use  20 times a day. There is software which will allow you to track your  banking and merge the data with Quicken or other banking software, store  maps, look up a zip code or area code, download entire books, play games,  create shopping lists, and with a modem, even let you surf the internet, or  send and receive e-mail and faxes. I even have my entire CD collection of  over 600 cd's stored by artist, title and song name which I converted from  a spreadsheet and stored on my Palm.

If you use Avantgo daily, then the V is going to hold  you back from fully utilizing this great site.The Vx, which is still pricy,  is an 8meg unit and far beyond the needs of the average user.If price is no  object, then this a great unit, except for the re-charging needs of being  in a cradle.

I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago, and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer (to HotSync  and restore the data) all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.   If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you, follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  (the one with the 'bump') must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Let's say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse,  briefcase, backpack, fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag, set it  down a little too hard, or even RUN with it, chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and you'll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost, I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second, I can't believe that they didn't install a back-up  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason (let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data).  Finally, 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.  The Palm IIIx is SUPPOSED to be a  powerful tool for powerful people.  I'd be surprised if the execs at 3Com  would utilize their own product."

I hated having to manually update my monthly planner whenever a  new year rolled in (things like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). Another  reason was because I wanted all my contact information to be in one single  place.  I had these info spread out all around me like a wild fire (some at  home, at work, in the bathroom, ah... just kidding on the bathroom, but you  get the point, right?). With this Palm I can have upto 12,000 people in my  address book (I have 100 so far and I've been telling people that the  10,000th person to go into my palm address book gets free dinner from me,  ha."

This really irrtated me.  When I  bought it (Dec. '99)it worked fine, when I replaced the batteries once, I  started to have problems like this.  Eventually, after some serious,  pissiness on the phone with representitive, they offered me a used unit.  I  sympathize with the electronics fan.

I bought the camera specifically for a trip to Europe and it broke on the second day.   The 25 shots or so that I did take were ok, but with no consistency.  Half  of the pictures were beautiful the other half were out of focus."

I travel a lot and take a lot of scenery.  I bought it two years ago, unfortunately 2 weeks before a trip. When I used the first sample film, the photos came out in 4X7 instead of the classic 4X6. The date did not imprint on the front of the picture although I had set it correctly. My mistake was to have sent in the warantee immediately. I ran back to my dealer who refused to take back the camera and refund full price (at that time almost $400). He said it would have to be sent for repair. As I had to leave on my trip. it was imperative to have a camera right away. He offerred to refund half of the price. So I was out of $200. When I wrote to Canon about how I was ripped-off, they took no responsibility.  As if I wasn't burned, I bought the same camera this past Christmas from ritzcamera.com.  This time the date did not imprint on the front of the photo.  I had used the sample 15 shot film in the kit. However, since I developed the film after the 30 day refund deadline,  ritzcamera refused to do anything about it. They suggested I bring it for repairs.  I am angry that a new camera should have any defects. The fact that the same thing happened twice is an indication of poor manufacture.  The attitude of ritzcamera.com also angered me. How dare they suggest that I repair this defective camera. If you are looking for a good little inexpensive point-and-shoot, buy the Olympus Stylus with panoramic. It takes beautiful shots and is a dream to use. Disappointed customer!"

We've been very happy with its performance, and found the picture quality much better than other cameras. In the last few months, however, the camera no longer accepts new rolls of APS film. Instead, it changes the cartridge from ""new roll"" to ""exposed,"" without taking any pictures. We brought this camera to the camera shop, and they told us that it was a common problem with this model, and that it would cost [a lot] to have it repaired. We then called Canon, and they did not admit or deny the history of this problem. They just told us that the new Z3 did not seem to have the same issues."

On a  recent trip to New york it was small and light enough for me to carry in my  handbag so it didn't scream TOURIST, yet produces beautiful photos,  including one lovely panorama of Central Park at twilight that I am going  to have blown up. I agree that in making it as ""idiot-proof"" as  possible the makers have sacrificed some of the bells and whistles you get  with a fancy SLR system, but for most of us civilians who just want some  decent photos and nice memories, I would recommend it wholeheartedly. One  teensy drawback is that it wasn't as good at eliminating red eye as I would  have liked, but this is a very minor quibble."

Yes, I sometimes get red-eye in low light, but a lot of that is caused by the compactness of the camera - the flash is too close to the lens to avoid ALL red-eye. Increasing the room lights helps. Other family menbers have had a series of 35mm Point-and-shoots, but the 370Z is better.  Reliable (at least for me), simple to use, with a zoom range that goes from true wide-angle (most don't) to portrait-length telephoto (the regular ELPH doesn't).  I still have my 35mm SLRs and 7 lenses for ""serious"" photography, but it sure is easier to carry the ELPH 370."

For such a small, lightweight camera, its picture clarity is remarkable (even when you enlarge the prints).   I took it as my only camera on a trip to Europe, and ended up with photos that compared favorably to professional postcards.  I've had this camera for a year and haven't regretted it for a moment.  I keep it in my purse for all those moments when people say, ""I wish we had a camera with us!""

I tried indoors, outdoors, sunny days, after dark and cloudy  days.  I have to tell you that repeatedly it felt like the pictures were  over-exposed.  The elf's ability to balance exposure to suit a setting  really goes haywire when it has to balance higher contrast.  The red-eye  feature didn't work so swell, and my pictures just weren't up to par.  We  are returning it and going digital.  I bought the digital elf and shot  several shots, printed them and they give me the pictures, color and  resolution I am looking for.  I think this little camera was a bit  overhyped."

He (she?) made good points and I wanted to address 2 of the 'weak spots' mentioned: 1- the on/off slider: don't use it. I had completely forgotten that it was there until I read this review. It's much easier to just pull out the flash to turn the camera on; this is also probably much easier on the mechanism (there is a transmission ratio between the slider and the flash, the flash moves about twice as far as the slider--the result is that when using the slider, the flash slams in and out very hard). 2- shutter release delay. The camera can be set to allow instant response to pressing the shutter release: press the self-timer and flash-mode buttons simultaneously (the camera will respond by blinking the green LED 4 times). With this set, the camera will go through all preparations to take the picture when the shutter release is pressed half-way in (focus, focal length, exposure, making sure the flash is ready if needed). Then when the camera indicates that everything is ready, pressing the shutter release fully will result in instant response."

I own 99.9% of them on CD, and now they all fit (except my Christmas and Classical CDs) onto the iPod AT ONCE.  Now when I play music on random I have 6552 songs cycling through.  I can listen to the iPod all day and not even hear the same artist twice!!  With the advent of iTMS I can download songs I hear from the radio, preview them for a while, and purchase the albums later.  I can't wait to see what happens to all of this when the windows market gets their version of iTMS.  Instead of Apple bragging about 10 million MP3s sold, it will be something like 100 million."
