My wife has an earlier one, which has a less comfortable handle but a removable inner sleeve that velcros closed. The newer style does not have the internal velcro closure, and this was a very costly omission for me.  My backpack, containing my 17"" Powerbook, tipped over, fully zipped, and fell approximately two feet to the floor, with the top of the backpack striking pavement. Fearing the worst but hoping for the best, I removed the computer and was horrified to discover that it had slid right through the internal flap and taken the full brunt of the impact, massively denting and dislocating the side of the computer and damaging the PCMCIA slot. Applecare does not cover this sort of damage, so I ended up eating a multi-hundred dollar repair bill.

535986,A2HZR1YZ581U72,0,1,82,B000BY9A3I,8/9/2008,3,11,12,Dirt Devil 082700 Vacuum,"Although this vacuum has great suction, I do have some observations to make.  First, if you have stairs, I don't recommend this one.  It ends up falling down the stairs every time you move.  It's too wide to sit on the wheels, and standing up, it is top heavy, so it tips over.  The second thing is that the attachments are supposed to attach to the body and handle.  If you try to do that, they fall off, or worse, break off.  It may be a good concept, but in practice, it just doesn't work.  Thirdly, the wand does not attach to the handle, and the attachments do not attach to the handle or wand.  They just push on.  When they decide to fall apart, watch out.  When they hit your feet, it hurts!!!  Now, here is the biggie.  The fourth problem I found has to do with pet hair.  If you use the beater brush attachment, and you have dogs or cats, you will only use it once, as the hair gets tangled around the beater bar and the wheels, rendering it useless, until you take it apart and pull all the hairs out.  So you will probably end up using the other wide attachment.  The fifth problem is that this attachment swivels in all different directions, but it doesn't return to center.  Every time you hit a furniture leg, the attachment swivels.  Now it doesn't sit flat on the floor, and you have to straighten it with your hand.  If you have a temper, you will be taking this one apart, too, to fix it after you slam it on the floor a couple of times. Again, I will say that it has great suction.  The high pitched squeal seems to be common to this type of vacuum, and if you are close to the cleaner, it probably won't bother you, but other people tend to get very irritated with it. It is evident to me that Dirt Devil built what they thought was a great vacuum, but they didn't bother to have it tested in the real world.  Relying on their reputation, they get your money.

Buying this from the Apple store would have cost me $150 more.  Now, about the computer- First off, I was shipped a unit with upgraded Processor (1.5ghz) and Video.  Also the Superdrive is dual layer, not single although I haven't been able to see if it works as a DL.  So I'm pretty pleased that I have an upgrade right off the bat. The slogan says BYODKM, so I'll tell you how I have it set up.  Apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse and the display is a 50' plasma TV.  This is a really cool setup for my kids, playing educational games. About 2 days after the unit was delivered, Apple released the new Intel version of the Mini.  Initially I was disappointed, but after looking at the new specs I realized I had bought the better PPC version.  The Intel version shares video with the 512 main memory and has no dedicated chipset seperate. The positives are: Small form factor, great performance, price.  You just can't beat OS X in terms of reliability.  I will not miss being a system administrator on my wife's dell, constantly scanning and removing malware.  Price-Got mine with a superdrive for $630 shipped. Negatives:  Memory.  Although units shipping now have a standard 512k, I really think I'll need to upgrade to at least 1mb.  Also, after having been a Powerbook user, there is a perceptable difference in the build quality.  Not bad mind you, but not quite up to par with the Powerbooks. Overall, a great machine if you already have your keyboard/mouse/display.  If not, the new imac is a much better value.  Why only 4 instead of 5 stars? Well, the superdrive seems to only want to burn at 2X, not the 8X as advertised.  Apple has nothing to remedy this issue yet, but will probably issue a firmware upgrade sometime. So my advice is to take the plunge and switch over to OS X, you'll be very happy you did.",215,Apple Computer,610.0,"Apple Mac mini M9687LL/B (1.42 GHz PowerPC G4, 512 MB DDR SDRAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)",CPUManufacturer->Motorola,Binding->Personal Computers,CPUSpeed->1.42,Brand->Apple,CPUType->PowerPC G4,HardDiskSize->80,ItemDimensions,Label->Apple Computer,ListPrice,Manufacturer->Apple Computer,Model->M9687LL/B,MPN->M9687LL/B,PackageDimensions,ProcessorCount->1,ProductGroup->Personal Computer,Publisher->Apple Computer,Feature->1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 processor with 167 MHz system bus,"Feature->512 MB DDR SDRAM (expandable to 1 GB), 80 GB hard drive, slot-loading Combo Drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW)","Feature->One FireWire 400 port, two USB 2.0 ports, DVI output, and VGA output (adapter included)","Feature->Built-in 10/100BASE-T ethernet, 54-Mbps AirPort Extreme wireless, and Bluetooth 2.0+EDR","Feature->Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger, iLive '05, Mail, and more included"

A recent article in Consumer Reports identified Apple computers as the most reliable computers and PC Magazine user surveys have reached the same conclusion. Furthermore,  Apple computers -- including this new, more powerful eMac -- are impervious to the viruses which regularly plague Windows-based PCs. Yes, most people use Windows-based PCs, but do you really want to be just another member of the PC herd -- with all of the problems and frustrations presented by Windows-based computers, including regular virus attacks -- or are you looking for a computer which is user friendly, seldom crashes, and is virtually impervious to viruses? If these virtues are more important to you than being one of the crowd, please seriously consider buying an Apple computer. This new eMac is Apple's latest and fastest iteration of its eMac series of compact, user friendly computers at reasonable prices.

I am a professional video editor with over 25 years of experience in dealing with professional audio and video equipment, and a picky discerning listener who can tell the difference between clean audio and not-so-clean audio. And I don't work for Klipsch. I've owned this system for nearly 3 years, and it has performed flawlessly. I don't undestand all the fuss from others about a constant hiss. It's overhyped, and frankly, I have to hold my ear to the satellite speaker and hope for perfect silence in the room for me to even begin to notice the hiss (and I'm not deaf) .... don't believe the exaggerations. I have connected a DVD player, my Apple G5, and my Apple Airport Express to these speakers, and everything sounds terrific. The Klipsch GMX-A 2.1 system clearly and faithfully reproduces the full audible spectrum, and gives you control over master volume and sub-woofer volume. The control pod has a headphone jack, RCA-type line inputs, and a stereo mini input as well, your choice. Actually, you can have both audio sources plugged in at the same time, a thing of beauty. The system is powerful and efficient, but to tell you the truth, the satellites are ugly. The latter being the only sacrifice for the great sound it reproduces, and not bad enough to deduct one star in the rating. Not that a plain black box looks any better, it's a subjective thing. When it comes to speakers, my priority is my ears, not my eyes. Don't just think of this system as ""multimedia"" computer speakers, they're much more than that. I'm planning on purchasing a second system to use with my new HDTV. It's not being marketed that way, but it seems unnecessary to me to own an amplifier, plus speakers, when you can have this powered all-in-one system instead. Remember, it's a ""2.1"" system, meaning 2 satellite speakers and 1 sub-woofer, so you won't be listening to true surround sound. But the day Klipsch sells a 5.1 system with wireless rear speakers, I'm in. Until then, it's good-ol' stereo for me. Amazon.com is a great place to purchase these (where I got mine)... it's a HEAVY package, and free shipping is an amazingly good deal.

Certainly not a techie or audiophile! A friend recommended Klipsch so this is what I bought. They're pretty easy to set up--the instructions are clear--and I think they sound great! To get what amounts to a new sound system at this price seems like a good deal to me. At first I heard no trace of the dreaded hiss or hum--and my ears are pretty sharp. But after a few days I realized that when the computer is completely shut down I could hear the barest trace of a hiss coming from the speakers. But when the computer is on the slight noise is completely drowned out by the normal hum of the computer and monitor. And when the computer is completely shut off I'm usually not close enough to hear the hiss at all. How one figures out in advance if it's going to bother you or not I don't know. But for me these speakers are a 5 so far.,0,Klipsch,149.99,"Klipsch GMX A 2.1 Personal Audio System (3 Speakers, Black & Silver)",Brand->Avalon Pr,BatteriesIncluded->0,EAN->0743878014006,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Delivers dynamic sound from any audio source, including PCs, CD, DVD and MP3 players, game consoles, laptops, television sets and VCRs",IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Klipsch,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

Firstly, as one reviewer stated before there is a slight hiss which comes from the speakers, possibly this has to do with individual electrical outlets, power strips, or interference.  Nevertheless it is quite minor in my opinion.  Secondly, at VERY low volumes one speaker is louder than the other.  Again, to many this may not be even noticeable, and at normal listening levels, the problem appears not to be present. OKAY, now for the positives, which I must stress strongly outweigh the negatives.  The sound of the system is startling, honestly I was shocked when hearing it for the first time, considering the price especially.  What has to be considered is that there may be some minor flaws in system which has this type of power and sound quality at this price point, but I repeat that the positives strongly outweigh the negatives.  Lastly, the system build is very nice, heavy nice material, can be installed in a matter of minutes.

A lot of people seem to have different ideas of just what $100-$150 buys when it comes to speaker systems.  I must admit I find the reviewers that seem to hold this particular system to the standard of world class audio components are  also going to have a hard time dealing with the fact that a Nissan cannot hold it's own on the track against a Ferrari.  If you are looking for the ultimate in a musical or soundtrack reproduction experience, look else where.  By that I mean do not look to a 2.1 speaker setup.  These speakers are excellent, are very easy to setup and adjust to suit your tastes, and do just about as good a job with sound reproduction as one could expect when dealing with a setup this size with ""out-of-the-box"" cables.  The hiss issue I read so much about is absent, but I run my computer with a grounded outlet and voltage regulator. I am happy Klipsch has a few offerings that fall below the $190 mark.  They are accurate, convenient, and most strongly recommended as a COMPUTER SPEAKER setup.

653463,A2EUVEQORWIPFT,0,0,51,B0000AE82C,12/14/2006,4,13,13,Very solid.,"I purchased Klipsch ProMedia GMX-A 2.1 speakers as a gift for my girlfriend to put in her rather small apartment (less than 500 square feet).  After hooking them up to her TV, I found myself pleasantly surprised, given that these days Klipsch, like Bose, is among the most over-hyped names in sound. THE GOOD: Set up was very easy.  The control module, while not wireless, has a good selection of inputs, which is the main reason I chose these over the older, THX ProMedias; I connected her TV via RCA cables and her iPod via a 1/8"" input simultaneously.  The sound, while not as deafeningly loud as every other review seems to claim, is quite clear and sharp.  With the subwoofer level set to about 35 percent, there is more than enough low-end to satisfy anyone.  The speakers' style, a take-it-or-leave it industrial design, actually match the colors of her TV also, making the whole ensemble quite subtle and attractive. THE BAD: Several users made mention of a static ""hissing"" noise coming out of the speakers, specifically the tweeters.  These seems to be an affliction across the line, as these ones suffer from it also.  That said, it is only noticeable when one is extremely close to the speakers, such as when your ear is right next to it.  And once music is playing, it's not noticeable at all.  What's interesting is that my Bose Companion3 speakers that I use for my laptop when I visit my parents' house has the same hiss.  Finally, the mid-range is not the greatest with these speakers, but quite frankly, that's to be expected with satellite/subwoofer systems that lack mid-sized cones. THE VERDICT: At under $150 including shipping, these speakers work extremely well for filling small rooms with crisp, clear, strong sound.  They won't strip paint at high volumes, but don't seem prone to distortion either.  They are certainly more balanced and sharper than the aforementioned Bose Companion3s, and cost some $100 less.  If you're looking at 2.1 set ups for a small room or apartment, I daresay you can't do much better than this (at least at this price), and if you can, I haven't heard it yet.",0,Klipsch,149.99,"Klipsch GMX A 2.1 Personal Audio System (3 Speakers, Black & Silver)",Brand->Avalon Pr,BatteriesIncluded->0,EAN->0743878014006,Binding->Electronics,"Feature->Delivers dynamic sound from any audio source, including PCs, CD, DVD and MP3 players, game consoles, laptops, television sets and VCRs",IsMemorabilia->0,ItemDimensions,Label->Klipsch,"LegalDisclaimer->This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind.

653465,A2BMZRO0H7TFCS,0,0,53,B0000AE82C,12/10/2003,3,174,210,Here's a devil's advocate review for your pleasure,"I was very close to purchasing these speakers from reading just the reviews on Amazon and on the brand reputation of Klipsch.  I wanted to see if I could upgrade from my Bose MediaMate speakers for just a little more money.  But I have firmly decided against the Klipsch.  Read on for my personal reasoning. PRO'S - Great sound - Plenty of input options - Convenient control module CON's - Continuous buzzing/hissing noise - Love it or hate it looks PERFORMANCE From every specification I've read and every review I've read, these speakers DO sound amazing.  1/3 of the volume limit is about what most people max out at before they begin to wonder whether they'll upset their neighbors or cause their picture frames to go flying off the walls.  This aspect of these speakers are what brought me to seriously consider them and I have no doubt that they are probably some of the best sounding 2.1 speakers you can buy, and at a semi-reasonable amount of money. FEATURES Wow, inputs galore and a very attractive looking control module, unlike those from Creative Labs and Logitech.  Should you desire, you can also purchase matching speaker stands for the GMX line.  A very flexible set of speakers for use with your PC, game system, or portable audio device. AESTHETICS Arguably, the ugliest speakers I've ever seen.  I think some people really appreciate the industrial look of these speakers, but I prefer something more elegant and simple. INTANGIBLES So here is why I decided not to spend my hard earned dollars.  There is a constant HISS that resonates from the speakers that you cannot get rid of.  This hiss exists also in the 5.1 version of the GMX and if you do some more research, you'll read plenty of people who have purchased this set and that is their primary complaint.  I don't want my speakers to hiss/buzz.  I only want to hear Eddie Van Halen's amazing guitar work, Freddie Mercury's tremendous vocal range, DJ Tiesto's bouncing beats, and my MONSTER KILLS on Unreal Tournament. SUMMARY I thought Amazon shoppers might appreciate the research I've done with these speakers and get a devil's advocate review.  I for one, always like to read the reviews of those who didn't like a product more, because it's the picky people who will tell you something about a product you won't know from reading a feature list on the box.  I gave the speakers 3 stars, which means I think they are ""OK.""  I am much happier with the value of my Logitech Z-2300's.  The average rating on both sets are 4.5, but the Logitech's have 816 customer reviews, while the Klipsch have only 53.
